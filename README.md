# Classifying New York Times Articles

The aim of the project is to compare two classifiers:-
1) Naiver Bayes
2) Neural Networks

The accuracy of these classifiers can be put to a test by using them to classify the contents of NYT articles into
their respective categories and comparing the predictions to the actual categories.
