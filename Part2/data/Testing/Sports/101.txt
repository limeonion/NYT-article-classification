Ex-Prosecutor’s Job: Flag N.F.L. Players - The New York Times
A shortstop for the Colorado Rockies is charged with grabbing his wife by the throat and shoving her into a hotel’s sliding glass door. A forward for the Atlanta Hawks faces drug charges after a car in which he is a passenger leads the police on a high-speed chase. A lineman for the Jets hits 143 miles an hour while driving his marijuana-scented Bentley on a Missouri highway, a loaded gun and a 12-year-old child aboard.
In the rarefied world of professional sports, the dispensing of justice in a manner both fair to the employee and protective of a game’s integrity is a continuing challenge. Should a league rely entirely on local law enforcement? Should dictatorial rights be granted to its commissioner? Should there be an arbitration panel in which both the league and the players’ union are represented?
The stated option chosen by the N.F.L., which has added its fair share to the annals of player misconduct, is no longer to defer to law enforcement but rather to conduct professional internal investigations that are not designed to please the head office, yet dispel the impression that its biggest stars seem above reproach.
This option largely comes down to a woman named Lisa Friel, whose league office is adorned with portraits of giants: the former Giants quarterback Phil Simms, the current Giants quarterback Eli Manning — and, most tellingly, Robert M. Morgenthau, the august former Manhattan district attorney.
Friel spent nearly three decades working for Morgenthau, serving for many years as the chief of his Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit. She said he had instilled in her a prosecutorial code of conduct: “You investigate every allegation that comes in; you investigate it objectively, sensitively and thoroughly. And when you get to the end of your investigation, you make an objective decision about what happened. That’s your job.”
Friel said she was applying those principles as the N.F.L.’s senior vice president for investigations — a position created in the wake of the league’s mishandling of the case of Ray Rice, then a Baltimore Ravens running back, whose chilling assault of his future wife was captured on surveillance video and became, among other things, a public relations disaster for the N.F.L.
Friel is responsible for investigating alleged violations of the league’s personal conduct code: domestic violence, sexual assault, animal cruelty, blackmail, extortion, racketeering, disorderly conduct, you name it. She emphasizes that the adjudications or dismissals of court cases do not dictate the outcomes of her own inquiries, which some officials in the players’ union find at times to be overzealous.
This means, for example, that even though Jets linebacker Sheldon Richardson pleaded guilty last month to speeding, running a red light and resisting arrest in connection with that Bentley episode — and even though he was fined $1,050 and sentenced to 100 hours of community service — the matter is not necessarily over, as far as the N.F.L. is concerned.
“We’re looking at whether his actions violated our workplace conduct policy, so we’re going to consider all the facts and circumstances,” Friel said. “Stay tuned.”
Her job, which is intended to establish much-needed consistency in the league’s handling of misconduct cases, is at the center of a decidedly alpha-male environment. But Friel, 58, sees it as a twinning of passions, “a perfect fit.”
To begin with, she is a devout Giants fan, a season-ticket holder whose basement in her Brooklyn apartment is, as The Daily Beast once reported, a blue-and-red shrine to the Jints. Among her earliest memories of growing up in New Jersey is watching a Giants game on a black-and-white television and asking her father: “Who are we rooting for, Daddy? The ones in the black uniforms or the ones in the white uniforms?”
Then there is her professional background. In addition to her 28 years with the district attorney’s office — a time memorialized on her office wall by a framed courtroom sketch of her in full prosecution mode — Friel worked for a security company as a vice president for a division specializing in investigating and consulting on sexual misconduct.In taking the position with the N.F.L., Friel said, she saw another opportunity “to do something that really mattered.” But in the curlicue way of fate, she owes her job to Rice.
Outrage and Overhaul
When video surfaced in 2014 of Rice dragging his apparently unconscious fiancée, Janay Palmer, from an Atlantic City casino elevator, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him for two games, only to apologize for the light punishment after an outcry. When more video showed Rice punching Palmer in the face and knocking her to the elevator floor, Goodell suspended Rice indefinitely, but the league’s inept handling of the case had already become a full-blown debacle.
The impact of the grainy video on league officials cannot be understated, Friel said, particularly on the teams’ owners. The ugliness and violence became vivid and real.
“When I saw that elevator video for the first time, I gasped,” she said. “And I’m no stranger to that. I think seeing that, visually, was fairly shocking — not fairly shocking, but very shocking — to everybody who saw it.”
Resolving to do better, league officials retained some advisers, including Friel, and consulted with dozens of experts, including advocates for victims of domestic violence. They developed mandatory training sessions for all N.F.L employees, revamped the personal conduct policy, and vowed to conduct rigorous independent investigations.
The policy established a baseline suspension of six games for specific violations — including domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse — with modifications allowed depending on mitigating or aggravating circumstances. There is also an appeals process.
Then, in April, Friel joined the N.F.L. full time. She would oversee investigations of allegations of off-field misconduct, and B. Todd Jones, a former director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, would handle discipline.
But the N.F.L. players’ union — which sometimes finds itself in the awkward position of defending herculean men who beat women — has contended that the far-reaching powers granted to Jones are supposed to be solely those of the commissioner, and that Friel’s investigations can remain open indefinitely, leaving players hanging. The union has filed a collective-bargaining grievance with an arbitrator.
Ten months into the job, Friel said she had encountered nothing that would fit a story line of a tough-minded woman fighting against an entrenched and wrongheaded male bastion. Instead, she said, everybody within the league has supported the mission — none more so than the chastened Goodell.
“You have to have buy in from the top, and we have that here,” she said.
Team owners have also signed on, Friel said, although she was quick to add that she would not presume to guess their motivation: perhaps a sense of social responsibility, perhaps a sense that the loss of a star player for preventable misconduct is “not helpful for your business.”
“I can tell you that when we go out and do these educational sessions, you see ownership in the room,” she said.
But Friel also rejects any story line that she is a co-opted cog in a public relations effort to stem an image crisis.
“I am a professional at what I do, and I take what I do so seriously, and the repercussions are so important, that I would never not do the right thing,” she said.
She added, “If I felt the pressure to do something other than that, I would go look for another job.”
The only issue (she declined even to call it a frustration) is the expectation by some of instant investigative findings following an allegation. Friel said that she was no longer in law enforcement, had no subpoena power and must pursue these cases more like a reporter or private investigator.
This means asking the local police department for incident reports, transcripts of 911 calls, photographs, interviews with responding officers. This means wading through redacted documents, being rebuffed by witnesses and alleged victims, waiting for the processing of freedom-of-information requests. This means hitting walls, putting together a to-do list, then waiting for the case to be adjudicated, dismissed or closed.
Then, Friel said, “we’re going to circle back and go through the whole list again.”
One advantage, she added, is that an N.F.L. employee, whether a player or an office worker, “needs to cooperate with the workplace investigation.”
Complaints by Union
Her style, though, has sometimes rankled the players’ union. George Atallah, a spokesman for the organization, cited a case in which Friel’s office initially interviewed New Orleans Saints running back Khiry Robinson — without a union representative present — about an altercation he had had with an intern, for which he was later fined by the team. The two sides soon resolved the matter, but Atallah said the episode reflected a disturbing attitude.
“The pursuit by the N.F.L. of these investigations only highlights their view of players as perpetrators,” Atallah said. “Rather than focus our energy and effort together on finding a fair and transparent disciplinary process, they have chosen to impose policies that we believe are overzealous and violate the collective bargaining agreement.”
Friel said she found it curious that the union would cite the initial lack of union representation in the Robinson case, given that “we apologized for the mistake and took steps to make sure it didn’t happen again.” And, she added, the league’s investigation found insufficient evidence that Robinson had violated the personal conduct policy.
So: Has Friel been busy? And if so, is that a good thing?
Friel said yes and yes, in part because she has been working on prevention when not conducting investigations.
“I take what I learn from these investigations and feed that back to the group of us working on the educational sessions,” she said. “Where did it go wrong? When could bystanders have stepped in? When could teammates have stepped in?”
But Friel declined to discuss specifics. At the mention of her having traveled to Cleveland in October to interview the beleaguered Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel, about a domestic episode for which the local police declined to file charges, she gave nothing more than a half-smile.
Over all, she said, the league’s efforts to educate employees and reduce cases of misconduct are a work in progress. “I don’t think we’ve hit the perfect place yet,” she said. “The perfect place is: We have done enough education and have enough resources in place so that we have none of these incidents anymore. That’s the perfect place.”
Kim A. Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence and one of the advisers to the N.F.L. during its annus horribilis of 2014, said she had been impressed with Friel’s commitment and depth of knowledge. But while the league has made some progress, Gandy said, much more needs to be done.
“They’ve instituted some very basic training for players and league officials,” she said. “It’s enough to scratch the surface — to raise awareness. But they’re not going to get very far with an hour of training, even with an occasional refresher.”
Gandy said that team owners and the league are faced with a “financial balancing act” when a star player is implicated in a case of domestic violence. “I would hope they would resolve that balancing act to protect victims and send a message to others who might do the same.”
Setting an Example
But Friel maintains that the league’s efforts have had an impact. The percentage of player arrests dropped 38 percent in 2015 — from 68 in 2014 to 42. “That’s huge,” she said.
She attributed the drop in part to the continuing education of employees. But the primary factor — “And let’s make no mistake about it,” she said — is the example that has been made of some of the players who have been disciplined.
Defensive end Greg Hardy, lately of the Dallas Cowboys, was convicted of assaulting and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend in 2014, while he was a member of the Carolina Panthers. He was later acquitted on appeal when the woman declined to testify (amid reports that she had received a settlement in a civil suit), but Friel successfully negotiated with law enforcement to receive access to the disturbing exhibits, including photographs.
“The distraction that was for their team — not exactly what they needed,” Friel said. 
Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson was convicted of reckless assault for beating his 4-year-old son with a switch. 
“Missed a season,” Friel said.
And, of course, there was Rice, who has yet to return to the playing field. 
“I can’t imagine that our players are not cognizant that Ray Rice has had enormous trouble being able to play again — that they don’t take away a message from that,” Friel said. 
But the three cases she cited are not necessarily sterling examples of jurisprudence in professional sports. All three — Rice, Peterson and Hardy — had their suspensions overturned or reduced on appeal, and for a while, Hardy and Peterson were even being paid while on suspension.
Despite some early missteps, league officials believe a tone has been set. If an internal investigation concludes that the N.F.L.’s personal conduct policy has been violated, Friel said, “you will be held accountable.”
Friel is taking her three adult children to the Super Bowl this weekend. Then it’s back to work.
A practice squad player for the New England Patriots was recently arrested on charges of groping two women and assaulting a man. A linebacker for the Indianapolis Colts was arrested and charged with reckless driving after being clocked in excess of 100 m.p.h. on an interstate, according to the police. And there are reports of another domestic incident involving Johnny Manziel.
