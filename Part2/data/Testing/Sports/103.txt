Track Chief Expects Dispute Over Russians’ Olympic Bid to Be Settled - The New York Times
A disagreement over how a select group of Russian track and field athletes can compete at the Olympics — either under their country’s flag or a neutral one — should eventually be settled, said Sebastian Coe, the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations.
The I.A.A.F. and the International Olympic Committee have been at odds over how to handle Russian athletes who apply for “exceptional” dispensation to compete in the Olympics despite the doping ban imposed on the country’s track and field team.
“They have to be out of the country, in an untainted system that we can verify is safe and secure, and free from malign influences,” Coe said.
The I.A.A.F. would allow a small number of athletes to apply to compete under a neutral flag. The I.O.C. has said such athletes would compete under their national banner in Rio.
“These details need to be worked through,” Coe said. He added that both organizations were determined “to create a level playing field for clean athletes.”
Tennessee Titans linebacker Derrick Morgan said the N.F.L. should study how medical marijuana could help players.
Morgan wrote on Twitter “it’s time for the @NFL to take an HONEST look into the potential medical benefits of Cannabis for its players.”
The post came after offensive tackle Eugene Monroe recommended that the N.F.L. stop testing players for marijuana. He was released last week by the Baltimore Ravens.
Pinch-runner Cameron Maybin easily scored on a bases-loaded wild pitch with two outs in the 10th inning and Detroit beat visiting Seattle, 5-4, to earn a four-game sweep.
It was the Tigers’ first four-game sweep of Seattle since August 1980 at Tiger Stadium.
Nelson Cruz homered twice and Chris Iannetta and Leonys Martin hit back-to-back drives for the Mariners, who lost their sixth in a row.
Mariners starter Adrian Sampson left the game with discomfort in his right elbow while warming up for the first inning.
Kyle Ryan (3-2) put a man on third with no outs in the 10th before earning the win.
Around the Majors Freddy Galvis homered and drove in a career-high five runs to help visiting Philadelphia beat Minnesota, 7-3, and end a nine-game losing streak. Galvis had a three-run homer and knocked in runs with a sacrifice and a sixth-inning triple. Phillies starter Jerad Eickhoff (5-9) gave up one earned run in six innings. Xander Bogaerts singled in the game-winning run in the 10th inning and host Boston beat the Chicago White Sox, 8-7, to avert a sweep. The White Sox loaded the bases with nobody out in the top of the 10th, but Craig Kimbrel (1-3) got J. B. Shuck on an infield pop-up, then struck out Tim Anderson and Adam Eaton. In the bottom half, Chicago’s Matt Purke walked two before Bogaerts lined a pitch up the middle, allowing Mookie Betts to score from second.
Jon Rahm had a professional debut to remember, shooting a seven-under-par 64 to take the first-round lead in the Quicken Loans National at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Md.
Rahm, 21, the only amateur to make the cut last week at the United States Open, had a one-stroke lead over Jhonattan Vegas and a two-stroke advantage over a pack that included Ernie Els, who won the 1997 Open at Congressional.
Alexander Povetkin, the Russian boxer who tested positive for a banned substance before a heavyweight title bout with Deontay Wilder countersued the champion in a dispute over their canceled fight.
The countersuit, filed ten days after Wilder sued Povetkin and his promoter for breach of contract, alleges that Wilder broke the contract by walking away from the fight after learning that Povetkin had tested positive for the banned substance meldonium rather than waiting for the World Boxing Council to decide what to do.
Povetkin’s suit, which also alleges defamation, seeks more than $34 million in damages. (REUTERS)
