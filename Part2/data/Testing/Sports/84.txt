For Dusty Baker, a Life in Baseball Trying Not to Be Defined - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — The two labels we affix to Dusty Baker say more about baseball than they do about him.
“The thing that really bothers me is how every time they mention my name, I’m either 66 years old or I’m an African-American manager,” Baker said before batting practice Tuesday, on a bench in the Washington Nationals’ dugout. “Why is either one so important, you know what I mean?”
This is how Baker talks: verbal volleys, back and forth, not so much a challenge but a checkpoint to make sure you understand him, to see if you have something to add. Why should baseball have just one older manager (the Mets’ Terry Collins) and just one other African-American (the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Dave Roberts) in that role? Experience and diversity ought to count for more.
Baker is often asked to ponder these questions, but he would rather not. His job is to get the most from the Nationals, a team with immense talent but little to show for it: two division titles in four years, without advancing in the playoffs. Now they are 14-5, leading the National League East, showing none of the dysfunction Baker had heard about. A team stalked by expectations appears free of pressure.
“If you think that having fun’s exhausting, try being miserable,” Baker said. “That’s a nightmare, am I right? Oh, boy, there’s nothing worse than being miserable where you work.”
The Nationals lost to Philadelphia on Tuesday, 4-3, and starter Max Scherzer did not pitch well. He struggled to command his fastball and needed nearly 100 pitches to wade through five innings. Yet with the Nationals trailing by two runs and the pitcher’s spot due up, Baker let Scherzer hit for himself.
“That fired me up,” Scherzer said. “I wanted to go up and get a knock, go out there for the sixth and try to pitch my best — and it worked.”
Scherzer singled to start a game-tying rally, then powered through a scoreless sixth. Baker believed in him, proved it with his decision, and Scherzer — the $210 million ace of the staff — left the ballpark feeling better about himself.
“Managers can say whatever they want,” Scherzer said, “but when they do something, that’s when everybody feels it.”
Scherzer, who has played for four managers in the last four seasons, said Baker reminded him of the retired Jim Leyland, another skilled communicator who was almost disarmingly honest and direct.
Of course, Leyland was also heralded for his in-game strategy, a skill for which Baker often gets less credit. Only one active manager, the San Francisco Giants’ Bruce Bochy, has more victories than Baker, who is 17th on the career list with 1,685 through Wednesday. Bochy has 1,714.
“We know how he handles the clubhouse and how the players love playing for him — we all heard that,” said General Manager Mike Rizzo, who hired Baker last fall to replace Matt Williams, who had not connected well with players and had been too rigid with game management.
“But what I have seen is: This guy knows the X’s and O’s of this game as good as any manager I’ve ever been around,” Rizzo said. “His preparation for a ballgame is unbelievable.”
Baker prepared for 19 years as a player without even realizing it. He would pepper his managers with questions born of curiosity, not ambition. He was 37 when the 1987 season began without him, and a seismic baseball moment that April changed his life.
Al Campanis, the Dodgers’ general manager, who had played with Jackie Robinson, said on “Nightline” that blacks might lack the “necessities” to be managers or general managers. The remarks, which led to Campanis’s resignation, had highlighted the institutional mind-set behind baseball’s poor hiring record for those roles.
“I was surprised, because he was one of the best ones there,” Baker said. “I was like, ‘Damn, if he feels like that, how’s everybody else feel?’ Al was probably one of the most fair guys there.”
Baker had always been viewed as a leader, in the Marines and in baseball. After Campanis’s remarks, he said, opportunities started to arise for him and a few others. When the San Francisco Giants offered Baker a coaching job after the 1987 season, he did not ignore the sign. This was a calling, Baker believed, and by 1993 he was managing the team.
He was the N.L. manager of the year three times and reached the 2002 World Series, but that is as far as Baker has gotten. He led the Chicago Cubs and the Cincinnati Reds to the playoffs, but was fired by the Reds after losing a wild-card game in 2013.
Baker spent the last two years at home near Sacramento, where he ran a vineyard, gardened, watched his teenage son play baseball and wrote a book, “Kiss the Sky,” about his weekend at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. He also analyzed the playoffs for TBS.
“I still watched baseball, because I love baseball, but you don’t let yourself get lonely or unhappy,” Baker said. “I was going to have a good time no matter what, anyway. I’m happy to be here, but I wasn’t unhappy not to be here.”
As opportunities go, his new job is hard to match.
The Nationals have the reigning N.L. most valuable player, Bryce Harper, who appears poised for an encore. Their staff, under the new pitching coach Mike Maddux, has been dominant. The team is using more defensive shifts, blunting the notion that Baker would be resistant to data-driven strategy.
Bill Walsh, the Hall of Fame football coach of the San Francisco 49ers, would tell Baker to keep evolving, to constantly seek what is new. It helps to have a 36-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old son, Baker said, because their ages bookend the ages on his roster.
“You walk into his office, he’s listening to hip-hop music — today’s hip-hop music,” said outfielder Chris Heisey, who had also played for Baker in Cincinnati. “And then an old-school song will come on, and he knows that, too. So he’s well versed in a lot of different areas of life, and he’s got something in common with everybody. He’ll tell you, too: He knows a lot about a lot.”
Baker knows enough not to be easily defined. He cares less now about outside critics, he said, and does not frame his job here by the pursuit of an elusive championship ring.
“One wouldn’t satisfy me,” Baker said. “I always said if I win one, I’d want to win two. And then, who knows, I’d want to win three. I ain’t limiting myself.”
For Johnnie B. Baker Jr., there will always be more frontiers to explore.
