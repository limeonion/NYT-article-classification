FIRST STEP TOWARD A UNION Players from the National Women’s Soccer League whose salaries are not paid by a national federation have formed the N.W.S.L. Players Association, a first step toward creating a union.
The move comes after the United States women’s national team agreed in early April on a new collective bargaining agreement with U.S. Soccer, the national federation. That deal includes salary provisions for the national team players in the N.W.S.L. The minimum salary for non-allocated players is $15,000.

Angelique Kerber is back at No. 1, replacing Serena Williams atop the WTA rankings. Monday’s move up from No. 2 gives Kerber her third stay in the top spot, for a total of 26 weeks.

The College Football Playoff is bringing a Super Bowl-style halftime show to the national championship game without bumping the marching bands.
ESPN and the College Football Playoff said that a musical guest would perform at halftime of this season’s title game, in Atlanta on Jan. 8, and that the performance would be aired on the network.
The halftime concert will be held in Centennial Olympic Park, near the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium. No artist has been booked, but ESPN is taking the lead on securing what it hopes will be an A-list performer with broad appeal.
The marching bands for each participating team will still perform in the stadium at halftime of the title game, and that performance will be aired on an ESPN channel to be determined as part of the network’s megacast. Fans without tickets to the game will be able to watch it and attend the concert in Centennial Park free of charge.
CHIEFS QUARTERBACK ROBBED The authorities in Texas said the rookie Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had escaped injury after being robbed. The Smith County Sheriff’s Office said Mahomes and three others were stepping from a vehicle on a driveway outside Tyler on Friday night when a man approached and gestured that he had a handgun in his waistband. Investigators say the man took property from the four and sped away.
Deputies later arrested two suspects and recovered items taken during the holdup. Sgt. Darrell Coslin said that the robbery appeared random and that Mahomes, who played at Texas Tech, was not targeted.
