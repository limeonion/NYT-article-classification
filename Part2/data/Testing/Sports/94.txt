In N.F.L. Case, Help in Analyzing Deal - The New York Times
The judge overseeing the proposed $765 million settlement between the N.F.L. and more than 6,000 players who sued the league for negligence and fraud has appointed a special master to help analyze the final agreement, which could be filed in days.
In a court filing, United States District Court Judge Anita B. Brody, from the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, chose Perry Golkin as special master to help assess “the expected financial complexity of the proposed settlement,” which was agreed on at the end of August.
Golkin will provide due diligence for the court and make “formal or informal recommendations” to the judge and the lawyers on both sides. Golkin will not be paid. Golkin was a partner at Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., one of the country’s largest private equity firms. He has a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and is a certified public accountant.
Special masters are frequently appointed in complex cases and multiple-district litigation like the N.F.L. concussion case, which involves more than 250 separate lawsuits against the league, NFL Properties and others.
Those cases claim that the league knew of the dangers of concussions but deliberately hid information from the players.
In a joint statement, the lawyers for the league and plaintiffs said they sought “prompt preliminary approval of the settlement agreement” and that they would “proceed on any schedule that the Court directs.”
The proposed settlement includes $675 million for players or families of players who sustained cognitive injury regardless of whether it was related to football. As much as $75 million will be set aside for baseline medical exams and a $10 million research fund will be established. In the settlement, the league did not admit any wrongdoing.
When the preliminary settlement was reached in August, Christopher Seeger, a lead lawyer for the plaintiffs, said players would start receiving compensation in about six months.
That now appears optimistic. The league and plaintiffs’ lawyers have not given Judge Brody a more detailed accounting of their settlement, a necessary step before players can be instructed how to accept or opt out of the agreement, a process that can take several more months.
When the preliminary deal was announced, only a handful of general details were included. Players with Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s, for instance, could receive up to $3 million; the estates or families of players who committed suicide and were found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy were eligible for as much as $4 million; and those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis could receive up to $5 million.
Some retired players have criticized the deal, saying it did not provide money for players who had mounting medical bills but did not have Parkinson’s or another more serious disease.
A few former players have suggested that they will opt out of the settlement and continue to pursue their cases in court. Last week, the former quarterback Craig Morton sued the league in federal court in a case that looks very similar to the more than 250 cases already filed.
