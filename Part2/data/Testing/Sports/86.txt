The Batter’s Box Gets a Little Boring - The New York Times
Todd Frazier snatched a bat from his locker recently and raised the handle to his head, behind his right ear, wriggling it like a fishing rod about to be cast.
“I used to want to be like Manny Ramirez,” Frazier, the Chicago White Sox third baseman, said.
Then he flipped around to the other side of an imaginary home plate, bent at the waist and dug his feet into the clubhouse carpet, parroting the gritty style of Mo Vaughn. There was one more he wanted to show, snapping back into a right-handed setup, spreading his legs wide and lowering the bat toward his belt buckle with a fearsome scowl: Jay Buhner.
Frazier is putting up offensive numbers this season that would rival any of those former sluggers. But Frazier’s own batting stance, while technically sound and often effective, is not nearly as memorable as the ones he enthusiastically mimicked.
So it is in baseball today, where personalization at the plate appears headed the way of bullpen cars and scorecards, disappearing from a game that it once spiced. Batting stances used to identify hitters as vividly as their uniform numbers — and, sometimes, there was a good reason for that. Stan Musial used to be so coiled in the box that fans watching on television saw more of the No. 6 on Musial’s back than of the tan on his face.
But in an age of advanced metrics, enhanced video and intensified coaching, the idiosyncrasies have been pretty much ironed out of the game. There is no Musial, and there is no Julio Franco, who aimed his bat at the pitcher from over his head before unwinding with tornadic gusto as the pitch approached. Nor is there a Phil Plantier, who crouched as a terrified Little Leaguer might when facing a fastball up and in.
And nor is there anyone like Gary Sheffield, arms violently flapping like windshield wipers in a torrential downpour. Or Moises Alou, legs splayed but knees connected as if magnetically paired, a contortion exhibition at each plate appearance.
Instead, a conspicuous sameness has befallen the batter’s boxes of the big leagues. The top stars of today’s era take stances that are essentially alike. Hitting experts say that the prevailing stance these days is near the plate, slightly open, hands raised — a simple, streamlined model of efficiency. Another word for it might be boring, especially when compared with the old lineups that used to burst with individuality.
Indeed, part of baseball’s appealing history can be traced to its diversity in those moments before the pitcher began his windup. Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner separated their hands. Duke Snider held his elbows up to his chin. There was the fidgety left arm of Joe Morgan and the rhythmic motions of Cal Ripken Jr., sliding the bat along his shoulder like the bow of a violin. Rickey Henderson leaned over the plate; Fred McGriff could hardly stand farther from it.
Some stances simply defied explanation. No hitting coach would advise trying to replicate that of the slugger Tony Batista, who hit 41 home runs for the Toronto Blue Jays in 2000 out of a stance that looked more appropriate for the ballet, beginning with his torso turned directly toward the mound and his bat dancing in front of him, tormenting the pitcher as if to say, “Just try to get it past me.”
Ripken cycled through about a dozen disparate stances during his time with the Baltimore Orioles, a habit he developed by riffing on those he admired while growing up.
“I’d try to copy all of them,” he said.
His varied looks spawned another generation of imitators, including Ian Kinsler, the second baseman for the Detroit Tigers. “I knew everyone’s stances,” he said, “and in the backyard I would do them all.”
These days, though, there is less of an instinct for experimentation. Something like “feel” — a quaint notion in today’s game — is becoming outmoded.
“Our type of hitting was more about feel and touch and timing,” said Will Clark, a former first baseman for the San Francisco Giants and the Texas Rangers. “Now, they’re looking at their mechanics.”
John Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball, said he rued this development.
“There’s some flavor lost, all in the name of greater efficiency,” Thorn said. “And if you’re a baseball fan of a certain age, like myself, you know on the one hand that the game today is better than it’s ever been. Yet it feels worse.”
In the game’s nascent years, there was no universally approved batting technique. There were no batting coaches. A defined batter’s box did not appear until 1874. Until 1886, hitters could inform pitchers where they wanted the ball, high or low, and the incoming pitch would dictate their stance. Often, they choked way up, or gripped the bat like an ax handle, hands spread. Some waved the bat in front of their bodies, thereby disrupting the pitcher’s aim.
“It was very much every man to his own,” said Peter Morris, a baseball researcher. “They used often vastly different types of bats, and many often made their own bat. And they used very different stances, too.”
Even the gaping stance of Batista had some precedents. In “A Game of Inches,” Morris wrote that Cap Anson, whose career began in 1871, had used a similarly wide stance and ample stride. And his stance was only slightly more pronounced than that of Nap Lajoie, the Hall of Fame infielder from the turn of the last century, Morris said.
Such quirks continued to define hitters as the game modernized. Stances evolved as pitchers evolved. Hitters once could drop their hands and wind up to swing, because pitchers, while deceptive, were not overpowering.
Babe Ruth and many others in the 1920s and ’30s favored a closed stance, their front foot pointed inward, away from the pitcher, partly in an effort to keep from yanking balls into foul territory. As pitching improved, so did the need for hitters to see the ball better: open stances, with the front foot pointed outward, came in vogue.
But all the while, players took different approaches. Hank Greenberg kept his bat parallel to the ground. Al Simmons strode backward. Joe DiMaggio spread his stance wide enough to touch each side of the batter’s box with his feet.
“He was like the Colossus of Rhodes,” Thorn said, “with ships sailing between his legs.”
Ted Williams, in his seminal 1971 book, “The Science of Hitting,” wrote that “feet and hand position vary more than anything else from player to player because, unlike golf, the baseball swing is not a grooved swing.”
But Williams also offered pointers. He said he spread his legs exactly 27 inches apart, his hands just below shoulder level, his lead foot slightly opened, but his stance generally closed. He believed in a compact setup, with the hands no more than eight inches from the body, which he considered a “stronger” position. He kept his bat vertical, which he said helped increase the “loop” in his swing, enabling him to put the ball in the air.
Williams was ahead of his time. Today’s hitters seem to be following the clinical approach that he laid out. “Everybody wants to get that Point A to Point B,” Frazier said. “A, foot down, to B, hands through.”
Sean Casey remembers being in spring training with the Cincinnati Reds in 2003 when a familiar voice called from the opposing dugout.
“I’ve been in the game 54 years and I’ve seen a lot of stuff,” yelled Don Zimmer, then the Yankees’ bench coach, “but I ain’t never seen this.”
Zimmer was so mesmerized by Casey’s stance that he grabbed the Yankees’ manager, Joe Torre, so he could take a look. Somewhat baffled, they watched Casey, a left-handed hitter, methodically lift the leg farthest from the pitcher rather than the one that strides toward him.
It was not a timing mechanism, Casey, now an analyst for MLB Network, revealed recently. Rather, Casey’s hips used to tighten up. So he raised his left leg up and down in the batter’s box to release his hips, and the motion stuck.
Naturally, even fans picked up on Casey’s odd stomp. During a game in Milwaukee, he heard people in the crowd counting in unison how many times he raised his leg.
“It totally got me off my game,” Casey said. “When I didn’t do it my next at-bat, people started booing me.”
Actually, a lot of distinct batting stances were born from necessity, guided by feel, hardened by superstition. Sheffield’s aggressive yo-yoing of the bat stemmed from a desire to feel the barrel in his hands. Rod Carew crouched so he would not be overpowered by fastballs up in the zone. Jeff Bagwell widened his legs to keep his head level.
Ripken tinkered incessantly with his stance, even when things were going well. In the batting cage, if he felt he was pulling off the ball, he would close up. If his swing felt too long, he would flick his hands to keep them from wrapping around his head.
“Normal adjustments you would make are if you couldn’t control your body movements,” Ripken said. “Like if you’re getting out in front and getting fooled, you’d spread your stance wider.”
In 1996, before the Orioles were to play the Cleveland Indians in an American League division series, Ripken was so excited to hit that he knew he was going to have trouble staying back on the ball.
“I decided, as a bold move, I was just going to spread out and put my bat on my shoulder,” Ripken said. “I got antsy and I started sliding my bat on my shoulder as I waited.”
He hit .444 that series. The so-called “violin” stance was born.
Cliff Floyd used to hold his hands near his cheek before abruptly dropping them toward his torso as the pitcher delivered. Opponents, he said, would often try quick-pitching him before his hands sank into place. But he learned to thrive with it.
“It got me in a good rhythm every time,” said Floyd, who, like Casey, is now an analyst for MLB Network.
Floyd would marvel at teammates whose stances he could hardly comprehend. Alou, whom he played with in Miami, seemed immobile in his crouch, yet always appeared among the league’s leaders in average. Todd Zeile stood perfectly upright with his bat resting against his collarbone in a pose that Floyd used to describe as “la-di-da.”
And Zeile said he had adopted the look of his stance from the former first baseman Steve Garvey.
“I started with that in youth baseball, and it developed pretty much into the stance I used all my life,” said Zeile, who now works for the SNY network.
Franco, with that bat extended over his head, always seemed the most outrageous of all.
“I used to say to him, ‘If you can hit like that, anybody can hit,’” said Floyd, who played with Franco with the Mets.
And yet, Floyd emphasized, the stance, no matter how unusual, does not really matter in terms of success and failure.
“All I care about is when you get ready to hit, the bat head needs to be in a position to stay flat through the zone,” he said.
His point was echoed by Alex Buccilli, who was an outfielder for Coastal Carolina University from 2011 to 2013 and who earned internet fame for what some considered the weirdest stance in baseball history — an open-legged, backward-leaning, crouching, arms-raised position that looked as uncomfortable as it did unconventional.
Now a hitting instructor in Myrtle Beach, S.C., Buccilli pointed out that his crazy stance was just a starting point, one that enabled his body to move into a consistent hitting position every time.
“A stance is personal,” Buccilli said, adding, “You can stand on your head for all I care, as long as you get to the same position after that.”
Gar Ryness has fashioned a career out of imitating famous hitters. If anybody has a vested interest in the future of batting stances, it would be Ryness, the Batting Stance Guy, YouTube phenomenon, author, speaker, entertainer and faithful practitioner of what he calls “the least marketable skill in America”: imitating batting stances.
Ryness argues that there are absolutely bizarre stances still alive in today’s game, though he acknowledged that they might be harder to find. He cited Brad Miller, the starting shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays, who stands at the plate with one hand gripping the bat while the other hangs limp at his side until the pitch approaches.
“He does the craziest thing I have seen in a batter’s box in 30 years,” Ryness said. “He stands there like Pete Gray,” a one-armed St. Louis Browns player from the 1940s.
There are others: John Jaso, a Pittsburgh infielder, stands with both feet treading the back line of the box; San Francisco’s Denard Span curls his front toe back toward the catcher; Cleveland’s Jason Kipnis points his barrel at the umpire; the Cubs’ Ben Zobrist pulsates his hands as if shaking the stubborn last drops from a ketchup bottle.
But because the megawatt sluggers of the current era — like Mike Trout, Bryce Harper, Giancarlo Stanton or Nolan Arenado — all use relatively straightforward stances, the others tend to get overlooked.
Thorn compared the waning of unique stances to what he sees on the pitcher’s mound, as windups and deliveries get simplified and more efficient, though that is most likely the result of an effort to reduce arm injuries.
For hitters, other factors are in play. Curtis Granderson, an outfielder for the Mets, said he had begun his career with a wide stance — “I thought it looked cool” — and restless hands that he had picked up by watching Buhner. But over time, hitting coaches have trimmed away at the excess motion.
“Guys are trying to get simpler, rather than having so many moving parts before they get to where they need to go,” Casey said. “The video proves it.”
Kinsler said: “Everything is so technical now because of the influence of video. You look at kids in golf, and all the kids look the same — they’re like robots. Nobody swings like Jim Furyk or Jack Nicklaus.’’
Some believe the increased velocity of pitches today is another factor, contributing to a desire by players to be hyperprepared to hit the fastball.
“So many coaches are saying, ‘Simpler the better,’” Floyd said. “‘As easy as you can keep it so you can hit the fastball.’”
Ripken, however, pointed out that Sheffield was one of the best fastball hitters in the game, even though his bat was pointing at the pitcher as he lifted his leg.
Ripken said he thought the explanation for all the current sameness lay in the fact that hitters were taking more batting practice than they used to and were carefully honing an ideal swing out of an ideal stance.
“I think the routines and the particularness of video has really changed,” he said. “The way that they search for answers is visually, and not by feel.”
Frazier lamented the lack of creativity in today’s batter’s box. In the clubhouse that day in the Bronx, he imitated Sheffield, Craig Counsell and Danny Tartabull. If he were left-handed, he insisted, he would hit like Vaughn once did.
“I wish I played with all those guys,” Frazier said. “It would have been awesome.”
It happened to be Play Ball Weekend at Yankee Stadium, and Frazier hustled off to greet local Little League teams. The young ballplayers watched Frazier go 2 for 4 out of a stance that was as efficient and unremarkable as the baselines on the field.
