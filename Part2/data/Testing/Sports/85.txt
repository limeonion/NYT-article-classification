Israel Advances to the World Baseball Classic - The New York Times
Israel qualified for the World Baseball Classic for the first time with a 9-1 win over Britain at MCU Park on Sunday.
Israel defeated Britain twice as well as Brazil to win the four-team qualifier and become the 16th and final team in the fourth W.B.C., which is scheduled to begin March 7 in Seoul, South Korea. Israel will play in Pool B with South Korea, the Netherlands and Taiwan.
South Korea is among the favorites in the tournament. Other favorites include the United States, Japan, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela.
Israel’s team was composed largely of Jewish American minor leaguers and former major leaguers, including catcher Ryan Cole Lavarnway, who had 3 R.B.I., and shortstop Scott Burcham, who was 3 for 4 in Sunday’s victory.
Because of Sunday’s victory, Israel should now be able to add a number of Jewish major leaguers to its roster. The possibilities include players such as the Brewers’ Ryan Braun and the Tigers’ Ian Kinsler.
