Detroit Lions at Green Bay Packers: Prediction - The New York Times
Lions (11-4) at Packers (11-4)
4:25 p.m. Line: Packers by 7 ½
You’ve got to love this game for the simplicity of its ramifications. No “Team A can lose to Team B but still win the division if Team C beats Team D.” The winner of this game wins the N.F.C. North, in addition to securing a first-round bye in the playoffs and hosting a game in the second round. The loser will still make the postseason but will face a tough path to the Super Bowl: road games in the first two rounds and a possible third in the N.F.C. championship game.
“It’s a great scenario to go into the playoffs with,” Packers fullback John Kuhn told The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. “You’re playing playoff football before it’s even the playoffs. You write a script for this at the beginning of the year and come down to the end, and you still have everything in front of you.”
Side note: The Lions have not beaten the Packers on the road since 1991, a string of 23 Green Bay victories over Detroit in Wisconsin.
Pick: Packers
