Baseball Diamonds Aren’t Forever: Bygone Ballparks of New York - The New York Times
When shortstop Don Zimmer’s throw settled into first baseman Gil Hodges’s glove to seal a 2-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates 60 years ago this month, the Dodgers had played their final game in Brooklyn. With the Dodgers gone from Brooklyn, so was professional baseball at their longtime ballpark, Ebbets Field.
Before long, Ebbets Field was gone, too, one in a series of ballparks that nurtured major league baseball in New York City before succumbing to the wrecking ball.
Five New York ballparks built in baseball’s “modern” era, which began early in the 20th century — Hilltop Park (1903-12), the Polo Grounds (1911-63), Ebbets Field (1913-57), Yankee Stadium (1923-2008) and Shea Stadium (1964-2008) — seeded much of the game’s history before being torn down. You can trace that history, and even more than baseball, below.
 First game: April 9, 1913. Philadelphia Phillies 1, Dodgers 0. “Brooklyn Starts Season a Loser. Benny Meyer Upsets Game by His Errors — Cold Chills 10,000 Fans.”  
Last game: Sept. 24, 1957. Dodgers 2, Pittsburgh Pirates 0. “Dodgers Defeat Pirates in  Ebbets Field Finale. M’Devitt Victor on 5-Hitter, 2-0.” 
Other games: An N.F.L. team played at Ebbets Field from 1930 to 1944, as the Dodgers (1930-43) and the Tigers (’44). The teams had three winning records in 15 seasons. … The Brooklyn Eagles of the Negro National League played one season there, 1935. Their owners, Abe and Effa Manley, later owned the star-studded Newark Eagles.  
Distinguishing architectural feature: 80-foot-high Italian marble rotunda. 
 Short porch in right field: 297 feet, although with a high wall and, eventually, a scoreboard and a net.  
Left-handed-hitting beneficiary: Duke Snider, 175 home runs at Ebbets Field.
Casey Stengel connection: Dodgers outfielder, playing at Ebbets Field from its opening season, 1913, through 1917. The teams were mostly terrible, except for a pennant in 1916. Dodgers manager, 1934-36. Those teams were also terrible, compiling a record of 208-251.
 Babe Ruth connection: Played two games at Ebbets Field for the Boston Braves in his final season, 1935; went hitless in eight plate appearances. Coach for the 1938 Dodgers.
Subway World Series: Brooklyn faced the Yankees in 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. “Wait till next year” except in 1955.
Music: The Sym-Phony Band, a group of fans who played in the stands during games. Sample number: “Three Blind Mice” for the umpires.
What’s there now: Apartments.
Fun fact: In 1931 a Gaelic football match was played at night under portable lights, seven years before the first night game there.
First game: June 28, 1911. Giants 3, Boston Beaneaters 0. “Giants Reopen Polo Grounds and Win”: The Times reported that more than 6,000 fans in the half-finished ballpark “saw Boston perform its customary daily act of being defeated.”
Last game: Sept. 18, 1963: Phillies 5, Mets 1. “Era of Mets Ends at Polo Grounds”:  The Giants had a last game in 1957 before moving to San Francisco. Then the Mets had a goodbye ceremony for the Polo Grounds in 1962. But Shea Stadium was not ready for the 1963 season, so they had one more Polo Grounds farewell.
Other games: The Yankees played at the Polo Grounds from 1913 to 1922. … The N.F.L. Giants played there from 1925 to 1955. The Titans/Jets of the A.F.L. played there from 1960 to 1963. … College football, especially Army. … The New York Cubans of the Negro leagues played frequently at the Polo Grounds from 1935 to 1950. … Jack Dempsey was knocked out of the ring there (but climbed back in and knocked out Luis Firpo in the next round). …  In the waning years of the Polo Grounds, auto racing was conducted. Richard Petty’s father, Lee, raced there.
Distinguishing architectural feature: Horseshoe or bathtub shape, depending on how you looked at it.  
Short porch in right field: 258 feet.
Beneficiaries: Mel Ott (323 home runs at the Polo Grounds). Babe Ruth (85 home runs in 227 games before Yankee Stadium opened).

Casey Stengel connection: Giants outfielder, 1921-23. Mets manager, 1962-63.
Babe Ruth connection: Played there three seasons for the Yankees (1920-22) plus in three World Series (losing the first two, in 1921 and ’22, when the Polo Grounds was the home for both teams).
Subway World Series: 1921-23.
Music: A chorus of 1,200 and a full orchestra performed Verdi’s “Requiem” in June 1916. The Times called it “impressive and interesting” and “as delightful as could be expected” given the open-air acoustics. The Giants weren’t playing because it was a Sunday. 
What’s there now: Apartments.
Fun fact: Polo was never played at this version of the Polo Grounds below Coogan’s Bluff, only at the original site, on 110th Street, in the 1880s.
First game: April 18, 1923. Yankees 4, Red Sox 1. “74,200 See Yankees Open New Stadium; Ruth Hits Home Run. Record Baseball Crowd Cheers as Slugger’s Drive Beats Red Sox, 4 to 1. 25,000 Are Turned Away. Gates to $2,500,000 Arena Are Closed Half an Hour Before Start of Game. Governor Smith Throws Out First Ball — Shawkey, in Great Form, Allows Only Three Hits”:  It was the first ballpark to be called a stadium.
Last game: Sept. 21, 2008. Yankees 7, Orioles 3. “A Long Goodbye to an 85-Year Run”
Other games: The N.F.L. Giants played there from 1956 to 1973.

Distinguishing architectural feature: Frieze decorating the top of the Stadium.  
Short porch in right field: Originally 258 feet, then 295 feet.
  Left-handed-hitting beneficiaries: Mickey Mantle (266 home runs, though not all left-handed), Babe Ruth (259) and Lou Gehrig (251).
Casey Stengel connection: Played in the first World Series game there as a member of the Giants in 1923, hitting the game-deciding home run in the top of the ninth. Yankees manager, 1949-60. They were terrific, winning 10 pennants and seven World Series in 12 years.
Babe Ruth connection: It was called the House That Ruth Built. He played there from 1923 to 1934.
Subway World Series: 1923, 1936, 1937 and 1951, against the Giants; 1941, 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956, against the Dodgers; and 2000, against the Mets. 11-1 in those Series.
Music: The first concert was a 1969 R&B show hosted by the Isley Brothers. Later artists included U2 and Billy Joel.
 What’s there now: Athletic fields, including three diamonds, adjacent to the new Yankee Stadium.
Fun fact: A year after the evangelist Billy Graham attracted 100,000 people, a Jehovah’s Witnesses convention drew more than 123,000 people to the ballpark in 1958. “Many of those outside munched hot dogs as they listened to the speeches over amplifiers,” The Times reported.
First game: April 17, 1964.  Pittsburgh Pirates 4, Mets 3. “Shea Stadium Opens With Big Traffic Jam.”
Last game: Sept. 28, 2008. Florida Marlins 4, Mets 2. “Bitter Repeat on. Stadium’s Final Day”
Other games: The Jets played at Shea from 1964 to 1983, and the Giants joined them for the 1975 season. The Yankees played there in 1974-75 while Yankee Stadium was being renovated. So in 1975, Shea was home to two major league baseball teams and two N.F.L. teams. Not especially good teams: The Mets were 82-80, the Yankees 83-77, the Jets 3-11 and the Giants 5-9. That’s an overall 173-177 record. The teams were 88-85 at Shea.
Distinguishing architectural feature: The big apple in center field.
Porch in right field: Not short at all, 338 feet.
Left-handed-hitting victim: Darryl Strawberry (127 home runs at Shea. With a fence 40 feet closer, how many?).
Casey Stengel connection: Managed the Mets there in 1964-65.
Subway World Series: 2000. The Yankees won.
Music: The Beatles ushered in the era of arena concerts, playing at Shea on Aug. 15, 1965, and Aug. 23, 1966. The Police drew 70,000 there in 1983.
What’s there now: A parking lot for Citi Field.
Fun fact: A dome was proposed for Shea in March 1965, and the city’s sports commissioner said it could be ready in 1966. Turns out, however, that the stadium’s foundation could not stand the weight.
 First game: April 30, 1903. Highlanders 6, Senators 2. “Baseball’s Big Crowd. Auspicious Opening of American League Grounds in This City. Home Team Won From Washington — New York National League Nine Lost in Philadelphia.” 
Last game: Oct. 5, 1912. Yankees 8, Senators 6. “Senators Force Yankees to Win. With Second Place Safe, Griffith Sends Nick Altrock Into the Box on Hilltop.”  
Other games: The National League Giants spent two months playing at Hilltop Park after the Polo Grounds burned down before the start of the 1911 season. … Columbia University’s football team rented the ballpark for its game against Williams on Oct. 8, 1904, forcing the baseball team then known as the Highlanders to relocate a doubleheader to Boston in the heat of a pennant race. The Highlanders lost both games and also lost the pennant to the Pilgrims (now Red Sox) by one and a half games. Columbia, however, won the football game.
Distinguishing architectural feature: The ballpark was built on high ground in Washington Heights, thus earning its name.
Distant porch in right field: 400 feet. Center field was even more unreachable: 542 feet.
Victim: Everyone. The best Highlanders “slugger” in that Dead Ball Era: Hal Chase, 20 home runs at Hilltop Park.
What’s there now: Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center.
Fun fact: The ballpark was originally, if briefly, called American League Park. And The Times called the team the Greater New York Club and the Greater New Yorks on opening day. They quickly became the Highlanders and before long the Yankees.
