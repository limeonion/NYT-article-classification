Where the N.F.L. Concussions Settlement Stands Now - The New York Times
PHILADELPHIA — The N.F.L. and retired players passed a major milestone on Monday when the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit here unambiguously upheld a district court’s approval of a settlement that could give players with severe neurological conditions as much as $5 million each.
The decision will make it much harder for the several dozen players who objected to the deal to continue appealing the case.
Even so, several steps must be cleared before retired players receive any money and the case is concluded. Here are a few questions that remain.
Q. Will the appeals continue?
A. Perhaps. Steven Molo, a lawyer representing several players who objected to the deal, has not said whether he will ask a higher court to hear his appeals. He and other lawyers representing objectors could ask the entire Third Circuit, not just a three-judge panel, to hear the case, or he could appeal to the Supreme Court. Though legal experts say it is unlikely either court will hear the case, even asking for an appeal can be time-consuming.
The losing side in the appeals court generally has 90 days to ask for the Supreme Court to review its case. The winning side then has 30 days to respond but can ask for an extension. The justices can act as soon as about three weeks after that second brief is filed, but there is no deadline on their end.
No money can be distributed in the case until all appeals are exhausted.
Q. What happens to the players, more than 100 of them, who opted out of the settlement and still have the right to sue the N.F.L.?
A. The appeals court ruling does not help the cases of those players. Judge Anita B. Brody of United States District Court, who has overseen the settlement since the hundreds of individual cases against the N.F.L. were consolidated in Philadelphia more than three years ago, can urge the players and the league to settle, perhaps for more than the players might have received if they had joined the settlement. The N.F.L. has an incentive to settle with those players because the judge has the discretion to send their cases back to the courts where they were first filed, forcing the league to spend a lot of time and money fighting them one by one. The N.F.L. could also wait for Judge Brody to rule on the question of whether the players’ cases should be governed by the league’s collective bargaining agreement, which could disqualify many of the claims.
Q. Could the deal be altered?
A. In theory, the N.F.L. could voluntarily enhance the settlement to make it more appealing to the players who opted out. For instance, in the current deal, the families of players who died and were found to have chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head trauma, are compensated only if the player died between 2006 and the date the settlement was approved last April. The N.F.L. could expand that window to include players like the former Oakland Raiders quarterback Kenny Stabler, who died after the April 2015 deadline.
Q. Once all appeals are exhausted, what happens?
A. Judge Brody has appointed two administrators to oversee the disbursement of cash payments and medical monitoring that the N.F.L. has agreed to provide. The plaintiffs’ lawyers have said it would take about three months to set up the infrastructure to allow retired players to apply for benefits. Payments could take longer to be disbursed because the players will need doctors to give them an acceptable diagnosis.
Q. How much will players receive?
A. Players who are found to have Alzheimer’s, A.L.S., Parkinson’s disease or other serious conditions covered in the settlement are eligible for up to $5 million. But there are deductions for the number of years a player was in the N.F.L. and his age at the time a condition was diagnosed, so the amounts could be far less. Settlements are also subject to Medicare liens. In essence, the federal government wants back any money it paid to care for players with these conditions. The plaintiffs’ lawyers could reach a deal with the government that, for instance, deducts 10 cents for every dollar that Medicare spent on a player.
Q. When do the lawyers get paid?
A. The plaintiffs’ lawyers asked for $112.5 million in legal fees, which would be paid by the N.F.L., not by the players. Judge Brody will rule on their request. Lawyers who represented some of the 5,000 players who originally sued the league may take a cut of any cash settlements that their clients receive.
Q. What happened to Riddell?
A. When the cases were first filed, starting in 2011, players sued the N.F.L. and Riddell, the helmet manufacturer that has worked with the league for many years. Riddell has argued that it be excluded from the case because it had nothing to do with the league’s handling of head trauma. Judge Brody must rule on its request.
