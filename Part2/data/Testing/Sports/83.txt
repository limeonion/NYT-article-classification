Mark Trumbo Is a Home Run Deal for the Orioles - The New York Times
The Baltimore Orioles bring their slugging show to Yankee Stadium for a four-game series starting Monday, and the best player in baseball advises fans to arrive early for maximum exposure to Mark Trumbo.
“He’s fun to watch,” said Mike Trout, the Los Angeles Angels’ star center fielder. “He’s one of those guys, when he’s taking B.P., you’ve got to stop what you’re doing and watch him.”
Trumbo, Trout’s former teammate in Anaheim, led the majors in home runs at the All-Star break with 28, part of the Orioles’ major-league-leading total of 137.
Trumbo has long been a titan of batting practice, one who has twice competed in the home run derby at the All-Star Game. He bashed 95 homers for the Angels in his first three full seasons, but he also struck out a lot and had only a .299 on-base percentage.
After moving to Arizona and Seattle in trades, Trumbo landed with the Orioles in December in a deal for Steve Clevenger, a backup catcher. The Mariners needed salary relief and cleared Trumbo’s $9.15 million. For Baltimore, though, he was a steal.
“This has been probably the most fun I’ve had in the major leagues, this team in particular,” said Trumbo, who can be a free agent after the season. “A lot of it has probably been attributed to the fact that we’ve played winning baseball. But for me personally, bouncing around a few times, you’d like to find a home at some point and stay there and be a contributor. I guess I’m hoping that’s the case here. So far, so good.”
The Orioles ranked ninth in the majors in runs last season, when they were .500. They are now in first place in the American League East, and they ranked fifth in runs before the All-Star break. Manny Machado, the Orioles’ star third baseman, gave Trumbo much of the credit, and not just for his power.
“He makes everybody better,” Machado said. “We talk about hitting more often in the dugout. He keeps people going. If he misses a pitch or a guy’s doing something, he picks it up, and we’re helping each other out. He’s done it all year. I think that’s why we have one of the best lineups in the league.”
Catcher Matt Wieters said he had always found it tricky to make a game plan against Trumbo, who has a more compact swing than most sluggers.
“He’s just able to get his leverage into it,” Wieters said. “He hits pitches that you shouldn’t hit out out, and I think it’s because of how short his swing is for a big guy. A lot of pitchers try to go places that normally, to a big guy with long arms, you can get in on — and you can’t get in on him.
“Also, for a big, strong guy, he has one of the most advanced hitting approaches I’ve seen, as far as how much he thinks about the game and how much he thinks about what the pitcher’s going to do to him.”
Trumbo said playing for a team built on power had helped reinforce the mind-set of driving the ball. But for all of his numbers — he also had a career-best .923 on-base plus slugging percentage and a major-league-leading 202 total bases at the break — Trumbo said the opportunity mattered most.
“The thing I’m most grateful for this year is, I’ve played in every single game, and as a player that’s all you can ask for,” he said. “You need those at-bats to be able to put up numbers.”
The case of Drew Pomeranz, who was traded from San Diego to Boston on Thursday, shows just how quickly a pitcher can transform himself by paying attention while playing catch.
Pomeranz was chosen fifth over all in the 2010 draft, by the Indians out of the University of Mississippi. He was then dealt three times in the next five years: to Colorado for Ubaldo Jimenez in August 2011, to Oakland for Brett Anderson in December 2013 and to San Diego for Yonder Alonso in December (with other players in each deal).
“I got to be around a lot of different people, a lot of great players,” Pomeranz said, “and I learned a lot from them.”
The player he may have learned the most from, though, was Travis Higgs, a former minor league catcher who played catch with Pomeranz in the winter at the University of San Francisco. Pomeranz had always thrown fastballs and curveballs, but he could never find a consistent third pitch. Then Higgs accidentally let loose a throw that acted like a cutter.
The pitch is often thrown like a four-seam fastball, but with an inward flick of the middle finger, subtle and late, imparting a sharp slice to the pitcher’s glove side just before the batter makes contact. Pomeranz, though, learned a different way to do it.
“I always thought to throw a cutter with my middle finger, and he explained to me about it coming off your index finger,” Pomeranz said. “I started doing that, and it just started working like it’s supposed to.”
The result was a 2.47 E.R.A. across 17 starts for the Padres. Pomeranz threw cutters with 12.8 percent of his pitches for San Diego, according to FanGraphs, and significantly raised his rate of curveballs to 39.2 percent. With a more complete arsenal — and far fewer fastballs — he has taken advantage of the chance he sought this spring, after spending most of last season in Oakland’s bullpen.
“When me and Andy initially talked, I said, ‘Look, I’m ready to do whatever you need me to do — I’ve done everything now after last year, and whatever helps the team the most, just tell me what to do,’” Pomeranz said, referring to Padres Manager Andy Green. “But once I got to spring training, I was feeling pretty good, and I called a meeting with him because I felt like he was going to probably put me in the bullpen. I asked for a chance to start. He gave me a chance to start — and now we’re here.”
Here meant the All-Star Game, where Pomeranz, 27, pitched a scoreless inning at Petco Park in his final appearance as a Padre.
The St. Louis Cardinals were the only team to use just five starters before the All-Star break, but another pitcher, the right-hander Alex Reyes, started for the World team at the Futures Game last Sunday. Reyes, 21, had a 4.35 E.R.A. in nine starts for Class AAA Memphis, but his stuff is dominant: He had 61 strikeouts in 41 ⅓ innings.
Reyes — who served a 50-game suspension at the start of the season after a positive test for a drug of abuse — can throw harder than 100 miles per hour and has lately emphasized a changeup. He needs to improve his control, but he could make a difference for the Cardinals later this season, in the bullpen if not the rotation.
“I feel like I’m ready,” Reyes said. “Whatever they ask me to do, I would definitely be willing to do that for them.”
Reyes was born in New Jersey and played at Elizabeth High, but he moved to the Dominican Republic in December 2011 to live with his grandmother. He immersed himself in baseball.
“When I was in high school, I played 25 games a season, so I didn’t get much exposure, and my parents didn’t have the funds to send me to the Perfect Game showcases and all that,” Reyes said. “So we thought the Dominican Republic would be something where the scouts would be able to see me more, and it worked out that way.”
A shortstop and pitcher in New Jersey, Reyes focused on pitching in the Dominican Republic, where he was not subject to the annual draft. Any team could bid on Reyes, and the Cardinals beat out Houston and Kansas City, signing him for $950,000.
Commissioner Rob Manfred called an international draft “inevitable” upon taking office in January 2015 and said last week that he still believed the sport needed more transparency in the international amateur market. But Manfred has backed off the idea of an international draft as the only way to do that, and Reyes doubts it could ever happen.
“There’s just so many guys and so many different countries,” he said. “It would almost be impossible for them to do a draft like that.”
Nowhere do baseball players sign more autographs than in the clubhouse at the All-Star Game. There are always several rows of tables filled with boxes of balls, jerseys, bats, lithographs and more. Most of the items are for the players themselves, and signing everything can take a half-hour or more.
Naturally, then, most players go for speed over style while signing, scribbling even sloppier versions of their regular hard-to-read autographs. The legible signature is a lost art, anyway, in the world of texting and email. But Boston’s Jackie Bradley Jr., at least, pays attention to detail.
Bradley, who started in left field for the American League, took his time with each signature, neatly scripting all 15 letters in a straight line. He said he was trying to compete with Michael Cuddyer, the retired outfielder whose elegant autograph always stood out.
“My mom made me rewrite all my schoolwork when I was young,” Bradley said. “It takes me longer, but I’ve got an A and a B signature. The B is like ‘JBJr,’ when I’ve got to sign for the masses.”
Indeed, Bradley’s quick scrawl of initials looks similar to that of many players, like Manny Machado and Mike Trout, who almost never write more than their initials. The difference is that Bradley varies his autograph based on who asks for it. Young fans, like fellow players, tend to get his best.
“Usually for kids,” Bradley said, “it’s A.”
