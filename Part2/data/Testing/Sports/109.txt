With More Chatter, Steelers’ Defense Is Dominating Early - The New York Times
PITTSBURGH — The difference in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ defense, inside linebacker Ryan Shazier insists, is not in what happens after the snap, but before it.
The younger players, like nose tackle Javon Hargrave, cornerback Artie Burns and safety Sean Davis, spent most of 2016 listening during their promising rookie seasons, but now they are talking. So is everyone else.
“It’s definitely a lot louder,” Shazier said. “Guys are aware of each other and what can happen on a play before they even line up in their formation.”
Shazier knows this better than anyone. He wears the dot on his helmet that designates the defensive player who has a radio transmitter, getting the call from defensive coordinator Keith Butler. The play is echoed up and down the line of scrimmage as the Steelers point, jump around and shout out reminders and tendencies.
“Once I call the play, everybody starts communicating: ‘They might run this, they might run that,’” Shazier said. “Or they’ll go: ‘Hey, slide over. You? Bump over and get in better alignment.’”
It might seem chaotic, but it is not. The proof is in the way the unbeaten Steelers are executing. Through two weeks, Pittsburgh has allowed just 474 total yards, fifth among teams that have played two full games. Sure, the Steelers have faced a rookie quarterback making his first N.F.L. start (DeShone Kizer of Cleveland) and another who got the starting assignment minutes before kickoff (Minnesota’s Case Keenum), but the team is confident its success is not a mirage.
“Everybody can say the quarterbacks or whatever, but we’re not really worrying about that,” Hargrave said. “We’re just going out there, playing, trying to get to the quarterback and stop the run.”
They did both on Sunday. In a 26-9 victory over Minnesota, Pittsburgh chased Keenum around the pocket and limited Dalvin Cook, the Vikings’ rookie running back, to 64 yards on 12 carries, 25 of them coming on one run in the third quarter that set up Minnesota’s only touchdown. It is telling that the unit’s lone major mistake — and not the other 55 offensive plays Minnesota ran to largely minimal effect — is what stuck with the Steelers.
“‘Just’ 91 rushing yards?” defensive end Cam Heyward said, referring to the Vikings’ total on Sunday. “That’s still too much. We’ve got to hold ourselves to a higher standard.”
And by that, Heyward meant the one that for so long stood among the gold standards in the N.F.L. The Steelers finished in the top 10 in yards allowed every season from 2000 to 2012, including five times when they were No. 1 over all. The precipitous slip began in 2013 as the team lost several important figures who had served as the core of three Super Bowl appearances from 2005 to 2010, including safety Troy Polamalu, defensive end Brett Keisel, cornerback Ike Taylor and the Hall of Fame defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau.
But the rebuilding process appears to be nearly complete. When camp opened, Coach Mike Tomlin chose an interesting word to describe the defense, saying it had the talent to be a “dominant” group. For a coach who rarely delves into the big picture, it was a startling pronouncement.
It may also end up being accurate. T. J. Watt, a rookie outside linebacker and J. J. Watt’s brother, has been a revelation in two games, picking up two sacks and an interception in the opener and swatting down a pass against Minnesota before leaving with a groin injury. Anthony Chickillo has done something considered nearly impossible for most of the last 12 years — he moved in front of James Harrison on the depth chart.
Harrison, 39, dressed but did not play against Minnesota, staying on the sideline when Chickillo filled in for the injured Watt. Chickillo finished with four tackles on defense, another on special teams and a hit on the quarterback. Harrison’s day off is more a sign of Chickillo’s progress, one mirrored in other parts of the defense.
Defensive back Mike Hilton, who made the team off the practice squad, picked up eight tackles and even found a chance to drill Keenum on a well-designed blitz. Joe Haden, signed at the end of training camp, had another quiet afternoon. Burns knocked down a pass and recovered a fumble that effectively sealed the competitive portion of things.
All those splash plays start with word of mouth.
“When you have communication from multiple guys, there’s less room for error,” Heyward said.
There have been few mental mistakes. A trip to Chicago and another quarterback with problems — Mike Glennon — await. The Steelers understand it is far too early to start thinking that they are back to their old selves. Maybe that’s because they are just simply not that old. Defensive back William Gay and defensive end Tyson Alualu were the only starters who were 30 or older against Minnesota. At the same time, Watt was the only rookie to get a significant number of snaps.
Pittsburgh’s defense is young but also experienced. After spending the off-season hearing about how it could be the weak spot compared to the “Killer B” offense, the reality could prove to be considerably different.
“It’s one of our big goals this year to be one of the best defenses,” Hargrave said. With both the offense and defense clicking, he added, “that’s a great combination.”
