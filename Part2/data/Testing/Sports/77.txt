Widespread Deceptive Practices May Reduce Payouts in N.F.L. Concussion Settlement - The New York Times
PHILADELPHIA — Lawyers for professional football players who reached a landmark settlement with the N.F.L. over concussions said Tuesday that hundreds of their clients may have been swindled by unscrupulous lenders and advisers looking for a cut of their payments.
In a hearing in federal court here, Christopher Seeger, a lawyer for the retired players who sued the N.F.L., said nearly 1,000 ex-players had signed dubious contracts with lenders and lawyers. Nearly a dozen lenders have lent money at interest rates of 50 percent or more to players who will pay them back with money they receive from the estimated $1 billion settlement, which provides up to $5 million to players with dementia, Parkinson’s disease and other serious neurological conditions.
In the last few months, players have also signed contracts with law firms and so-called claims service providers that promise to help players file settlement claims in return for 10 or 15 percent of any cash awards. Some of these firms work with the lenders as well as brokers, who receive fees for referring players.
“We don’t want to watch these awards be cannibalized,” Seeger told Judge Anita B. Brody of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, who is overseeing the settlement. Judge Brody had called the hearing in response to news reports, including those in The New York Times, of what she called “purportedly deceptive or misleading solicitations” of former players.
Such practices have sowed confusion among retired players. Some of them are in dire financial straits and have borrowed money at rates well above legal maximums. Other players have signed contracts with lawyers and advisers to help them fill out paperwork they could file on their own.
The federal Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, have sued a New Jersey-based financial company, RD Legal Funding L.L.C., accusing it of deceiving retired N.F.L. players and “luring them into costly advances on settlement payouts with lies about the terms of the deals.”
In July, Brody gave Seeger permission to compel the lenders and law firms to turn over information about how they sought to sign up players. In all, Seeger pursued documents and information from 36 people or companies, though some firms did not cooperate.
Seeger and a partner, TerriAnne Benedetto, detailed a litany of questionable practices, including charging players thousands of dollars in fees for loans with 50 percent interest rates; lenders paying fees to brokers for referrals; and former players being paid fees to convince those who qualify for the settlement to sign agreements with lawyers and lenders, some of whom promised to introduce the ex-players to doctors who could help them get larger amounts in the settlement.
Benedetto provided several examples, including a player who received $10,000 from a lender but will have to pay back $17,310 from his settlement payout in one year. Another received $312,000 from a lender but will have to pay back $568,000 once he receives his settlement.
Benedetto also mentioned Joe Pisarcik, a former quarterback for the Giants and the Philadelphia Eagles who once led the N.F.L. Alumni Association and had access to a database of retired players. Pisarcik received $200,000 from two law firms that wanted to use his name to help sign up former players.
She said Pisarcik was also offered bonuses of up to $75,000 for every 25 players with diagnoses covered under the settlement that he referred to the law firms.
Benedetto said that Pisarcik provided emails that showed that he tried to stop the lawyers from sending a deliberately misleading pitch letter with his name on it to former players. The law firms represented 92 former players before they retained Pisarcik, then signed up an additional 241 clients after he became a consultant to the firms.
Benedetto said that some lenders had refused requests for documents.
To date, 1,200 claims from former players or their representatives have been filed, out of about 20,000 players who are eligible to file claims.
More than $130 million in claims have been approved so far, mostly for players who had previously received a diagnosis for a condition covered by the settlement. Some of that money has not been dispersed yet, though, because the settlement administrator must deduct money to repay Medicare and legal fees. Some awards have also been audited because of potential red flags, including doctors thought to have written incorrect diagnoses for players.
Seeger told the judge he was worried, though, that the administration of the settlement could get bogged down if the lenders or lawyers ask the claims administrator to be paid before players receive their awards.
Seeger said that he may ask the judge to pursue criminal claims against lawyers and advisers who filed false claims or asked doctors to write improper diagnoses for players.
