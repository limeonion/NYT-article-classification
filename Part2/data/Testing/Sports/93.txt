Free-Agent Axis Tilts From Anthony to James - The New York Times
Carmelo Anthony enjoyed the unique privilege of being the N.B.A.'s most coveted free agent for a little more than 36 hours. That ended Tuesday morning when it was revealed that LeBron James had informed the Miami Heat through his agent, Rich Paul, that he intended to exercise the early termination option on his contract and become a free agent July 1.
In one fell swoop, the best player on the planet instantly became even more powerful. By opting out, James now has the opportunity to investigate other locales while putting pressure on the Heat to improve their roster. And he should have considerable leverage, given his talents: Where should he take them next? He might wind up staying put, but weeks of intrigue are sure to follow.
The news was not surprising — no less an eminence than Pat Riley, the Heat’s president, said he had expected James to opt out — but it still caused tremors across the league. It is not often that a four-time most valuable player goes unattached, and it seems safe to assume that many general managers were reviewing their tattered copies of the Woo LeBron Plan, many of which had been collecting dust since the summer of 2010, when James was last a free agent.
James’s choice — The Decision, Part II — could also affect Anthony, who opted out of his contract with the Knicks on Sunday and is no longer exploring free agency in a vacuum. Potential suitors have only so many dollars to spend given the restrictions of the salary cap, and James is the most desirable player on the open market — for now, if not forever.
It might be worth pausing here to emphasize that the Heat are the favorites to retain his services. James, 29, has made four trips to the N.B.A. finals in his four seasons in Miami, and won two rings. James has also built relationships with Riley and Coach Erik Spoelstra, although those bonds could now be tested.
“We look forward to sitting down with LeBron and his representatives and talking about our future together,” Riley said in a statement.
That there are even questions about James’s future is due almost wholly to the Heat’s most recent trip to the finals, which went poorly. They did not lose their best-of-seven series to the San Antonio Spurs on a buzzer beater. No, they were bulldozed by a superior opponent that exposed the Heat’s lack of depth and Dwyane Wade’s physical limitations. It was apparent to anyone watching that Miami would need more than a bit of fine-tuning in the off-season; in fact, it would need several new pieces.
The problem for the Heat, as it often is for teams navigating the choppy waters of the salary cap, is money: namely, there is not enough of it to go around. The first step for the Heat would be getting James, Wade and Chris Bosh to agree to new deals that allow the team to fill out the roster with improved talent. Like James, who was to earn $42.7 million over the next two seasons, Wade and Bosh have opt-out clauses. But unlike James, they have yet to inform the Heat of their plans.
Wade, in particular, will be worth watching. He is set to earn $41.6 million over the next two seasons. Given his injury woes and his age (32), he is unlikely to command that type of salary again. Can the Heat persuade Wade to opt out and make a financial sacrifice for the greater good of the team, perhaps by stretching out the money he is owed in a longer-term deal? If Wade chooses not to, James could be gone.
Miami’s Big Three are expected to meet and talk things over in the coming days, but even as they do, teams will be lining up to pursue James. Potential destinations include the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have Kyrie Irving, the No. 1 pick in Thursday’s draft and the romanticized narrative of James returning to his roots; the Chicago Bulls and the Houston Rockets, two teams that would be instant contenders and could clear the necessary cap space to pay James his millions; and the Los Angeles Clippers, who are led by one of James’s high-profile friends, Chris Paul.
If James leaves Miami for anywhere but Cleveland, he runs the obvious risk of being branded a mercenary, a superstar in search of the quick fix and the ready-made contender. Riley seemed to allude to that last week when he told reporters: “You’ve got to stay together, if you’ve got the guts. You don’t find the first door and run out of it.”
How any of this has the potential to affect the Knicks is unclear. One possibility: If signing James is Plan A for a team like the Bulls or the Rockets, that means Anthony is now Plan B and marginally improves the odds of his returning to the Knicks next season. Then again, there is always the small chance that a rival could clear enough cap space to sign James and Anthony as a tandem. The Los Angeles Lakers could conceivably make that happen, although both players would need to sign for deep discounts given the $48.5 million owed to Kobe Bryant over the next two seasons.
In any case, the Knicks are very much spectators in the new LeBron sweepstakes. Even if Anthony signs elsewhere, the Knicks — as currently constructed — will exceed the salary cap next season. That means no James and no high-profile free agents, at least not until the summer of 2015.
That was not the case when James was a free agent in 2010. The Knicks had spent several seasons exercising fiscal responsibility in anticipation of their courtship of James. They tried to sell him on the idea of being a superstar in New York. He chose to play with his friends in Miami.
Left with lots of money to spend, the Knicks signed Amar’e Stoudemire. Due more than $23 million next season, Stoudemire has an early termination option. He does not plan to use it.
