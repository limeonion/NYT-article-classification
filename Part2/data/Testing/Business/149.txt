2016’s Winning Investors Talk About 2017, and Donald Trump - The New York Times
Last year was one of unusually big surprises for markets — none more so than the election of Donald Trump. Not only were many money managers and experts dead wrong about his chances, but they were doubly wrong in betting on a big market sell-off in the event he won.
Mr. Trump’s victory kicked off a continuing stock rally that left the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index up nearly 10 percent by the end of the year, a gain few anticipated a year ago.
But there were other major moves in markets last year. After interest rates hit what some have called a 5,000-year low (but who’s counting?) — and moved into the through-the-looking-glass realm of negative returns in some parts of Europe — they suddenly reversed course in the United States, rising abruptly toward the end of the year as expectations for growth and inflation soared.
Even more striking was the abrupt turn in oil and commodity prices, which rippled through the economy and markets. A year ago they were in free fall, with no end in sight. But after hitting a 13-year low of less than $27 a barrel on Feb. 11, they ended the year above $53.
A year ago, investors were treating oil and commodity companies like Freeport McMoRan (a stock I highlighted last year) as all but dead. By the end of the year, its stock had more than doubled — a reminder that contrarian bets, when they prove right, can deliver huge returns.
Again this year, I turned to some prominent investors and market experts who successfully maneuvered through what turned into a treacherous year, asking them for insights into how they did it and what they expect in 2017.
“I was ridiculed,” Anthony Scaramucci told me this week, referring to his early and vocal support for Donald Trump. Unlike many on Wall Street, the outspoken Mr. Scaramucci — the founder of SkyBridge Capital, host of a revived “Wall Street Week” television show on the Fox Business Channel and author of several books on business and investing — went all in for Mr. Trump after initially backing Jeb Bush.
Nor did the so-called Trump rally come as a surprise to him. “To put it simply, if you get a 35 percent corporate rate reduced to 15 percent or even 20 percent, you’re looking at a 30 percent earnings increase for most companies,” he told me as he took a short break from the Trump transition team.
SkyBridge focuses mostly on hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments, but also offers a high-yielding stock mutual fund, the SkyBridge Dividend Value Fund. The fund gained over 15 percent last year, handily outpacing the S.&P. 500.
As a long-only fund — one that invests in securities for their potential gains and doesn’t short stocks, or bet on potential declines — “we benefited enormously from the Trump win,” Mr. Scaramucci said. “It’s true that contrarians often get things wrong. But when they get it right, there’s a tidal wave. Trump is an example. The conventional wisdom was that he couldn’t win. Assets were priced relative to the conventional wisdom. So when he did win, there was huge upside.”
Mr. Scaramucci attributes his contrarian view of Mr. Trump in part to the fact he lives on Long Island, a stone’s throw from his working-class parents, and not among the Manhattan elite, even though he’s an alumnus of Harvard Law School and Goldman Sachs. “Everyone in the local bar, from the bluest- to the whitest-collar workers, was voting for Trump,” he said.
But Mr. Scaramucci isn’t blindly contrarian. He did initially bet wrong on Mr. Bush. “I pivoted,” he said. “Everyone makes mistakes. The question is, How do you adapt? All entrepreneurs have to do that.”
Now Mr. Scaramucci is in the Trump inner sanctum as a member of the transition team, in a position not only to predict the future, but also to help shape it.
Not surprisingly, he’s bullish on the economy and stock market for 2017. He expects the kind of high-dividend, value-oriented stocks his fund invests in (some of its biggest holdings last year were Best Buy, Caterpillar and Boeing) to do well unless “we get to hyper-growth, in which case there will be a rotation to growth stocks.”
He said fears of a Trump-induced trade war were overblown. “No one wants a trade war,” he said. “All we’re calling for are fairer free-trade arrangements around the world.”
He added: “We’re not coming at this from a position of ideological purity. There are a lot of practical business people in the room. We’re not asking if something is right or left, but whether it’s right or wrong.”
Jerome L. Dodson is the founder and president of Parnassus Investments, and lead portfolio manager for the Parnassus Endeavor Fund. He champions the notion of doing well by doing good. “Certain social and environmental values are really important to us,” he told me this week.
His fund doesn’t invest in fossil fuels. He seeks out companies that treat their employees well and where turnover is low.
In a highly competitive world where cutthroat capitalists scoff at such values, he’s also emerged on top: His Parnassus Endeavor Fund is ranked by Morningstar as the No. 1 fund in its category (large-cap growth) over one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods — a remarkable feat.
Mr. Dodson follows a highly disciplined approach that considers only companies trading at less than two-thirds of their intrinsic value — a subjective assessment of the actual value of a company, without regard to its market price — which makes him as much a value investor as a growth investor.
He doesn’t worry much about typical macro events or predictions, like the outcomes of presidential elections, the direction of interest rates, or oil prices. He doesn’t claim to be much of a forecaster, and said he was surprised that two of his fund’s positions — John Deere, the farm equipment icon, and Cummins, the engine maker — ended up doing so well last year. “All you can do is look for good companies that are undervalued,” he said. “There is no way to know when they’re going to go up.”
A typical investment for his fund was the chip maker Micron Technology, whose shares had been battered by declining revenue and a global chip glut. Mr. Dodson calculated that Micron shares were trading at just one-third of their intrinsic value when he bought them for an average of $10.80 a share. Equally important, Micron “is a great place to work, with good employee benefits and relatively low turnover,” he said. Last year it was the Endeavor Fund’s largest holding.
This week it was trading above $22, more than double the fund’s average cost. “We are holding onto the stock but wouldn’t buy a lot more today,” Mr. Dodson said.
Indeed, with the market so high, it’s getting hard for Mr. Dodson to find stocks that meet his intrinsic value criteria. Ideally, he’d like to have about 40 stocks in the fund. Currently he has just 25.
“It’s fair to say I’m cautious about the coming year,” he said. “That’s because valuations are so high.”
Still, “if Trump can deliver some of what he’s talking about, which is tax cuts and infrastructure spending, and the economy starts growing at 3 percent, then earnings will increase, causing the price-to-earnings ratio to come down,” he said. “That would make me more positive about 2017.”
Will resurgent oil prices continue to drive markets?
In all likelihood, yes, said Damien Courvalin, head of energy research for the Goldman Sachs’s global investment research commodities team. Mr. Courvalin makes a rare return appearance this year, after pretty much nailing it in his forecast for 2016. Last year he predicted further weakness in oil prices, followed by a recovery by the year’s end — which is just what happened.
This year Mr. Courvalin and his team are predicting $59 a barrel for Brent crude over the next three to six months, with prices stabilizing in the longer term at $55 to $60.
That’s because a price much above $60 is likely to cause a supply surge, especially from United States shale producers.
But Mr. Courvalin said investors should focus less on price than on inventory. When high current inventories drive down spot prices, high-cost producers are at a disadvantage, but can still sell forward futures contracts at a premium. More normalized inventories lower or eliminate that incentive and reduce price volatility, which is a benefit to low-cost producers like Russia and Saudi Arabia.
Because of that shift in the forward futures curve, there is upside potential for oil and commodities investors even if price gains in the spot market are modest. “You want to see demand levels that are strong, and we’re getting there,” he said.
This has little to do with Mr. Trump or his policies. While the president-elect is seen as likely to encourage higher United States energy production, a higher supply will be offset by stronger demand and a stronger dollar. In any event, it’s likely to take years for any Trump policies to affect market supply and demand.
“We expect oil demand to be good next year,” Mr. Courvalin said. “We’re at a point in the business cycle where you can expect to see much better returns from commodities than from equities, based on historical patterns.”
