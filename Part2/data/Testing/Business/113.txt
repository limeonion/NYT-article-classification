6 of Larry Kudlow’s Not-So-on-the-Money Predictions - The New York Times
President Trump has a new chief economic adviser. Larry Kudlow, the CNBC commentator who served in President Ronald Reagan’s Office of Management and Budget, will become the director of the National Economic Council, a position being vacated by Gary D. Cohn, who said he would resign after losing an internal battle over the president’s plan to impose tariffs on foreign metals. 
Mr. Kudlow, often on-air and with a flair for provocative punditry, has prognosticated on many economic and political issues in a way that mirrors his future boss. 
His predictions, which will soon carry new weight as the president’s top economic adviser, have not always been on the mark. The following is a look back at some of his economic predictions that did not bear out.
Analysis: Well, we all know what happened. By 2008, the housing bubble popped, home prices were in a free-fall and the mortgage-backed securities that banks had loaded up on were threatening to plunge those firms — and the economy — into the abyss. 
Home prices in 20 metropolitan areas across the country dropped at a record rate of 18 percent in October 2008 from a year earlier as the fallout from the financial collapse reverberated through the housing market. The housing market has still not recovered completely or evenly and prices in many cities are still below their pre-recession peak.
Analysis: The Obama administration’s plan to help homeowners included a litany of programs, including reducing the debt that distressed borrowers owed. The success of these programs was mixed but recent studies show that they did, in fact, help millions of people stay in their homes.
Mr. Kudlow’s claim that the markets were already “solving” the housing problem was not accurate, given that the housing market still has not recovered in many areas, including those hardest hit. 
In 2009, banks were — and in many cases remain — incredibly reluctant to make loans to all but the highest-quality borrowers. That does not generally include new and younger families, who have little credit history and are considered riskier than those with a track record of on-time payments. Without the government assisting borrowers who were in danger of foreclosure, the economic fallout from the crisis would have been even deeper, more severe and longer-lasting.
Analysis: That solid economy was not so solid after all and Mr. Greenspan’s prediction of a recession came true. By December 2007, the United States was officially in the Great Recession. The budget deficit did not evaporate but ballooned and continues to grow today, with the nation approaching a $1 trillion annual deficit.
Analysis: Recessions do help reduce leverage — or debt — that households and businesses have since loans are no longer easy to come by and creditors demand repayment of past debts. But Mr. Kudlow’s “credit crunch” assessment was flawed. Households and businesses did face a real “credit crunch” as banks retrenched and restricted lending to all but the most sterling borrowers. 
Analysis: The period between 1990 and 1999 was the longest bull market in history. The S&P 500 more than tripled during that time and there was not a single bear market or dip. The so-called dot com bubble helped fuel that rise until it all came crashing down in the spring of 2000, a situation created by speculation rather than Washington’s economic policies.
Analysis: President Trump was elected and the stock market has only climbed. While there have been moments of volatility and days that ended in the red, the United States is still experiencing a bull market — stocks were up more than 300 percent at their peak in late January. It’s a financial metric that his new boss is quite fond of citing and taking credit for.
