William Dudley, New York Fed President, Is Expected to Retire - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a vocal proponent of improving the “culture” at big banks, was expected to announce his retirement as early as this week, according to two people familiar with the decision.
Mr. Dudley, 64, became president of the New York Fed in January 2009 when he replaced Timothy F. Geithner, who left to become treasury secretary under President Barack Obama.
After joining the regional Fed bank in 2007, Mr. Dudley took the reins in the midst of an economic recession, as Wall Street was still reeling from the 2008 financial crisis. He was a key player in the Fed’s efforts to shore up the economy, including its bond-buying campaign known as quantitative easing.
Mr. Dudley’s successor will play a crucial role in policing Wall Street as policymakers in Washington take steps to loosen some of the regulations that had been imposed on banks after the crisis.
The next president of the New York Fed will also take Mr. Dudley’s place as the vice chairman and a permanent voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions about interest rates and the purchase and sale of securities on the open market. Mr. Dudley has voted in favor of the Fed’s current approach to monetary policy.
In a speech last month, Mr. Dudley said that while he remained puzzled about why inflation had yet to meet the Fed’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, he believed that raising rates slowly continued to be the right path.
“I expect inflation will rise and stabilize around the F.O.M.C.’s 2 percent objective over the medium term,” he said. “Thus, even though inflation is currently somewhat below our longer-run objective, I judge that it is still appropriate to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation gradually.”
He is expected to retire sometime this spring, the two people familiar with the decision said, and a search is underway for his successor. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Mr. Dudley’s decision publicly. CNBC earlier reported Mr. Dudley’s plans.
Unlike the Fed chairman, regional Fed bank presidents are not political appointees and are not chosen by the president. They are selected by a committee composed of members of the Fed’s board of directors who are not affiliated with financial institutions, and the selection is subject to approval by the Fed board in Washington.
On Thursday, President Trump nominated Jerome H. Powell as the next Fed chairman, bypassing the current chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, for a second term, in part because of her forceful defense of the post-crisis banking rules.
While Mr. Powell is not seen as someone who will dismantle Wall Street regulation, Mr. Trump has made clear his desire to roll back many of the rules imposed on banks in the wake of the financial crisis. Mr. Trump’s pick for Fed vice chairman of supervision, Randal K. Quarles, has spoken about the need to revise or rescind some banking rules.
The New York Fed, along with other bank regulators, came under stiff criticism following the 2008 crisis for failing to spot — and stop — the risky behavior that had landed Wall Street in trouble. The New York Fed was accused by lawmakers and other critics of being too close to the banks it supervised and being unwilling to demand information from the firms.
It also came under scrutiny when a former employee, Carmen Segarra, told ProPublica that the New York Fed had gone easy on Goldman Sachs and claimed she had been terminated over her objections to changing her findings about the bank. The New York Fed said the assertion was unfounded, and a lawsuit she filed claiming wrongful termination was dismissed.
Soon after the financial crisis, a report on the New York Fed’s practices by a Columbia University professor, David Beim, found that the regulator must be “willing to stand up to banks and demand both information and action,” and was “too risk-averse to respond quickly and flexibly to new challenges.”
Mr. Dudley has been among the most outspoken critics of “cultural failures” at large financial institutions and has criticized their leadership for not doing enough to impose a strong tone at the top. In 2014, Mr. Dudley warned bank executives that regulators would consider breaking up big firms if they did not do enough to prevent wrongdoing.
Before joining the New York Fed in 2007, Mr. Dudley had spent two decades at Goldman Sachs, where he was most recently the bank’s chief economist.
