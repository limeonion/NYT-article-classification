• Buck Sexton in The Federalist:
“Right now, considering the ongoing political siege against the administration, this looks like an unnecessary risk that could turn into a major blunder.”
Mr. Sexton warns Republicans who have hailed the appointment of Robert S. Mueller III as a positive step to be careful what they wish for. While he concedes that the move will restore public faith in the ability of federal law enforcement to deal with such a politically charged matter, he has little confidence that Democrats and “assorted Trump critics in media” will refrain from using the investigation for “partisan ends irrespective of the eventual outcome.” Read more »

• Rick Wilson in The Washington Post:
“Sticking with Trump to the bitter end and pretending the unfolding chaos is just ‘fake news’ won’t save your reputation as the walls close in. It won’t ease the judgment of history. It won’t do anything to polish up your future Wikipedia entry.”
Mr. Wilson has been a Republican consultant for thirty years, and during that time, he writes, he’s dispensed with a lot of private advice. Now, Mr. Wilson — who vociferously staked out his position as a never-Trumper from early in the campaign — feels compelled to speak publicly to Republican staffers working for the administration. His message? The time to quit is now. Read more »

• Robert W. Merry in The American Conservative:
“The elites figure that if they can just get rid of Trump, the country can return to what they consider normalcy — the status quo ante, before the Trumpian challenge to their status as rulers of America.”
Launched by Patrick J. Buchanan, in many ways The American Conservative reflects the distinct political ideology of the current administration in its critique of neoconservatism. Here you’ll find writers supportive of military isolationism, and skeptical of unfettered free trade and immigration. Mr. Merry, the publication’s editor, responds to the suggestion of impeachment (by both Democrats and never-Trump conservatives) with a warning: Removing the president will not solve the intractable rift between America’s heartland and “the elites.” Read more »

• Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review:
“Democrats are so Trump-deranged that I suspect, despite Mueller’s solid reputation, they will claim the fix is in if impeachment does not appear to be on the horizon in short order. But most people will give Mueller a chance. And he deserves that.”
Mr. McCarthy is no great fan of special counsels, which is why his endorsement of Mr. Mueller for the job is noteworthy. He writes that Democrats and Republicans alike should have faith in the job Mr. Mueller will do, but he worries about how Democrats will react if his investigation doesn’t reveal what they hope for.

• David Frum in The Atlantic:
“A special prosecutor could wrap the investigation of the Trump-Russia matter in secrecy for months and years — and ultimately fail to answer any of the important questions demanding answers.”
Written all the way back on May 14 — an eternity in the current news cycle — this piece by Mr. Frum is still worth reading after the news of Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Here, Mr. Frum highlights what he sees as a crucial distinction between a special prosecutor and an independent commission: The former seeks crimes, while the latter seeks “truth.” Mr. Frum’s preference is an independent commission.

• Kyle Smith in National Review:
“If Trump leaves office prematurely for any reason, President Pence will immediately be denounced as far worse.”
Mr. Smith speculates that if Democrats are able to remove President Trump from office, they will not greet Vice President Mike Pence with a sigh of relief and open arms. After sounding the alarm on just how “abnormal” the Trump presidency is, liberals will quickly return to tearing into “normal” Republicans like Mr. Pence as well. Read more »
_____
• Noah Rothman in Commentary:
“Responsible conservatives have ceded the latitude to shape conservative positions to disreputable provocateurs, thus repulsing persuadable voters. Sober-minded conservative Republicans are obliged to take their ideas back.”
Speaking of “normal” Republican values, Mr. Rothman thinks his party has lost sight of traditional conservative ideals. So he takes it upon himself to remind fellow conservatives what their values looked like before Mr. Trump came along. [Note: Commentary only allows one free article per month.] Read more »

• Adele M. Stan in American Prospect:
“It seems questionable to me that Pence was blissfully ignorant of Flynn’s transgressions.” 
Ms. Stan begins her article by telling her readers to “keep your eye on Pence.” Written before our reporting on what the Trump transition team knew about Michael T. Flynn before he was hired as national security adviser, her piece is prescient. She notes that Mr. Pence’s ties to Paul Manafort and his role as the head of the transition team warrant further scrutiny, and perhaps even investigation. Read more »

• Jeet Heer in New Republic:
“It’s a mistake to think that Pence would be a more competent or popular president, one capable of enacting the right-wing agenda that has eluded Trump.”
For liberals who may already be steeling themselves for a Pence presidency, Mr. Heer has good news: The vice president would not signal a “bigger disaster” for the progressive cause than Mr. Trump. While he warns his readers not to indulge in the “impeachment fantasy” too quickly; those who are inclined to do so have little to fear from a Pence administration. Read more »

• Karen J. Greenberg in The Nation:
“It’s a rare, and almost surreal, moment in American history when a chief law-enforcement official becomes the hope of the rule of the country across the political spectrum.”
Despite her concerns about embracing a law-enforcement official “who helped frame the policies of the post 9/11 era,” Ms. Greenberg, nonetheless, is hopeful in the selection of Mr. Mueller. “By temperament and experience,” she writes, Mr. Mueller is a possible antidote to what she sees as the Trump administration’s disdain for the rule of law. Read more »

• Josh Marshall in Talking Points Memo:
“These two options — special counsel or independent commission — are often bandied about as two separate options, one or the other, or as steps of escalation in a scandal. None of those things is true.”
Mr. Marshall makes the case for both a special counsel and an independent commission. While he believes Mr. Mueller is a “good pick,” he says the role of special counsel is “necessary but not sufficient.” Pointing out that such an investigator serves at the pleasure of the president, Mr. Marshall is skeptical that Mr. Mueller will be able to uncover everything that the American public needs to know about the 2016 election.

• Josh Barro in Business Insider:
“And if Comey had resigned, [...] then Trump would have been able to replace him with a loyal supporter who could have sought to kill the Flynn investigation more quietly.”
If, as the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey’s memo alleges, Mr. Trump asked him to obstruct justice, shouldn’t Mr. Comey have just quit? That’s how much of the right has responded to the news that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey to “let it go.” Mr. Barro explains why he thinks Mr. Comey stayed: He had an ethical duty to the American people to “stay in place, refuse the unethical request and keep a paper trail.” Read more »
_____
• Steven Harper in Moyers and Company:
“Pence was on the ticket that Putin helped to elect in 2016, and Pence’s legal training vests him with a heightened accountability for his dishonesty.”
Like Ms. Stan’s article above, Mr. Harper’s piece was written before the news broke of what the Trump transition team knew about Mr. Flynn. Here, he indicts Mr. Pence for “enabling a dangerous president” and sacrificing “core principles of democracy.” Read more »
_____
• David Kris in Lawfare:
“Bob Mueller is a public servant of the highest order. The last few days have been tumultuous, but his appointment makes me feel better about our country.”
Mr. Kris, along with other writers for Lawfare, wholeheartedly endorses the appointment of Mr. Mueller to the role of special counsel. Mr. Kris, who worked with Mr. Mueller in the Justice Department, has this to say about him: “He is utterly incorruptible. He cannot be intimidated.” Read more »
_____
• Michael J. Glennon in Harpers:
“Those who would counter the illiberalism of Trump with the illiberalism of unfettered bureaucrats would do well to contemplate the precedent their victory would set.”
Given the flood of leaks that appear to come from the intelligence community, it is worth reading this feature by Mr. Glennon, a man who has encountered the national security bureaucracy first hand. His measured discussion of the security community’s function in any administration is steeped in historical context and analysis. It is against this backdrop, and after a careful explanation of the necessity of an independent and empowered intelligence community, that Mr. Glennon cautions the president’s critics of embracing a “security bureaucracy as their last best hope.” It’s an alliance that might just backfire.

• Dana Milbank in The Washington Post:
“The deputy attorney general’s decision [...] reduces partisan pressures that were very clearly harming the national interest.”
Mr. Milbank has high praise for the man who appointed Mr. Mueller to his new role: the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein. Mr. Rosenstein, he argues, did a favor to congressional Republicans: His decision “rescues Ryan, McConnell and other G.O.P. leaders from their own cowardice in refusing to demand more accountability from Trump.” Read more »

Ben Smith in BuzzFeed:
“What, Washington is reasonably asking, does Flynn have on Trump? That may be the right question. Flynn’s lawyer suggested he has a ‘story to tell.’ But an old book and a new movie hint at something else.”
Given all the trouble Mr. Flynn has caused, the question many people are asking is why the president has stood by his embattled national security adviser for so long. Mr. Smith, editor of BuzzFeed, speculates that this might have less to do with any “dirt” Mr. Flynn has on the president, and more to do with a principle of radical loyalty illustrated in a new movie coming to Netflix.

• Matthew Nussbaum and Theodoric Meyer in Politico:
“I find it unlikely that Trump is going anywhere,” one G.O.P. lobbyist, who spoke on condition of anonymity, wrote in an email. “That being said, Pence is well-liked on the Hill, fairly predictable and doesn’t stir up much unnecessary drama.”
As the president finds himself embroiled in controversy after controversy, conservatives in Washington are finding themselves imagining a future with Mr. Pence as their party’s leader. And they don’t mind what they see. Then again, this article was reported before the news of what Mr. Trump’s transition team knew. Read more »
