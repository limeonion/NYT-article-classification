Democrats Seek Special Counsel to Investigate Russian Election Interference - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee called on Tuesday for the appointment of a special counsel to lead the criminal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, saying the appointment was necessary to shield the inquiry from the appearance of political interference by the Trump administration.
“This is about more than just one individual,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the panel’s ranking Democrat. “This is about the integrity of the process and the public’s faith in our institution of justice.”
But the Republican chairman of the panel, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said he saw no need for the appointment of a special counsel as the panel took up the confirmation of Mr. Trump’s nominee to be deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein.
“There are times when special counsels are appropriate,” Mr. Grassley said. “But it’s far too soon to tell here. And even if there were evidence of a crime related to any of these matters, once confirmed, Mr. Rosenstein can decide how to handle it. I know of no reason to question his judgment, integrity or impartiality.”
Because Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from overseeing any criminal investigation into 2016 campaign matters, Mr. Rosenstein would be in charge of that case if he is confirmed.
The circumstances that led Mr. Sessions to step aside — the revelation that he had spoken twice to the Russian ambassador last year, despite telling Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, at his own confirmation hearing in January that he had had no contact with Russians — led to a heated moment.
Mr. Franken read from a letter Mr. Sessions sent to the committee on Monday that insisted his answer had been true because he understood Mr. Franken’s question to be about Russian contacts in his role as a surrogate for the Trump campaign, not his role as a senator, and said he had not previously seen a need to correct or supplement that answer because no one had “suggested otherwise.”
Mr. Franken called that “insulting” and demanded that Mr. Sessions be called back before the panel. Mr. Grassley, raising his voice, accused Mr. Franken of having asked Mr. Sessions a “gotcha question,” and the two briefly shouted over each other.
In rejecting Democratic calls for a special counsel, Mr. Grassley noted that Mr. Rosenstein — the United States attorney for the district of Maryland — was a longtime prosecutor who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama.
Ms. Feinstein, however, said her call was not related to Mr. Rosenstein’s integrity, but the need to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. She also said that the prosecutor should be a nonpartisan person who is appointed “independently” rather than by the attorney general.
However, the law that permitted the appointment of an independent counsel by a three-judge panel, rather than by the attorney general, has expired. Under Justice Department regulations for special counsels, Mr. Rosenstein, if confirmed, would essentially be the attorney general for the purpose of the Russia case since Mr. Sessions recused himself. It would be Mr. Rosenstein’s decision to appoint a special counsel, who would answer to him.
The exchange came at a Judiciary Committee hearing on whether to confirm Mr. Rosenstein, as well as Rachel Brand, whom Mr. Trump has nominated to be the associate attorney general, the Justice Department’s third-ranking official.
Throughout the morning, Mr. Rosenstein repeatedly parried questions about the investigation into Russian interference and whether he would appoint a special counsel to handle it, saying that he has not yet been briefed on any investigation the department may have into the 2016 election.
“I am simply not in a position to answer the question because I don’t know the information,” he said.
But Ms. Feinstein pointed to the decision in 2003 by James Comey, who was then the deputy attorney general and is now F.B.I. director, to bring in an outsider to investigate a leak of the C.I.A. operative Valerie Plame’s identity that might be tied to the Bush White House. That case led to the conviction of I. Lewis Libby, a top aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, for making false statements to the F.B.I. (Mr. Bush later granted him clemency.)
Ms. Feinstein said cases like the Plame leak showed the need for independent, outside eyes to examine allegations of wrongdoing that might lead back to the White House — as she said could happen in the current controversy over Russia’s election meddling.
She appeared to grow frustrated as Mr. Rosenstein explained the circumstances and legal issues that might influence his decision about whether to hold on to the investigation himself or bring in an outsider. “I’m trying to figure out what your bottom line is,” she told him at one point.
And when Mr. Rosenstein pleaded ignorance about any investigation, Democrats repeatedly pointed to an unclassified intelligence report that concluded that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia ordered an influence operation to harm Hillary Clinton’s electability and potential presidency and to help Mr. Trump.
Mr. Rosenstein said that as a prosecutor the issue for him was “what I can prove in court,” but that he had “no reason to doubt” what the intelligence agencies concluded. He also assured Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, that he would not be on Russia’s side.
“Senator, I don’t know the details of what, if any, investigation is ongoing, but I can certainly assure you if it’s America against Russia or America against any other country, I think everyone in this room knows which side I’m on,” he said.
Mr. Rosenstein has served for nearly 12 years as the United States attorney in Maryland — longer than any other United States prosecutor. Despite the pressure from Democrats over his refusal to say whether he would appoint a special counsel, he remains likely to be approved by the Republican-led Senate as the deputy attorney general, which would make him the manager of day-to-day operations at the 115,000-employee department.
The Russia controversy dominated the hearing, but Republicans and Democrats questioned Mr. Rosenstein and Ms. Brand on other civil and criminal policies.
Several Democrats said they were particularly concerned about a series of civil rights stances that Mr. Sessions has taken to roll back Obama-era policies on transgender protections, voting rights and other areas. Mr. Sessions was scheduled to meet Tuesday afternoon with a group of civil rights leaders who planned to raise their concerns directly with him.
