Republicans Try to Block Moore’s Path as Candidate Denies Sexual Misconduct - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans scrambled on Friday to find a way to block Roy S. Moore’s path to the Senate, exploring extraordinary measures to rid themselves of their own nominee in Alabama after accusations emerged that he had made sexual advances on four teenage girls when he was in his 30s.
Mr. Moore, meanwhile, remained defiant, insisting in a radio interview with Sean Hannity that he would stay in the race. He told Mr. Hannity, the Fox News host, who has endorsed Mr. Moore’s candidacy, that he “never had any contact” with Leigh Corfman, the woman who told The Washington Post that Mr. Moore touched her sexually when she was 14, though he did not deny dating some teenagers.
“I have never known this woman, or anything,” said Mr. Moore, who described the accusations as “politically motivated.”
Republican senators and their advisers, in a flurry of phone calls, emails and text messages, discussed fielding a write-in candidate, pushing Alabama’s governor to delay the Dec. 12 special election or even not seating Mr. Moore at all should he be elected. In an interview, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, declined to say whether he would agree to seat Mr. Moore should he win. Mr. McConnell deferred a question about a possible write-in campaign by Senator Luther Strange, the current occupant of the seat, to Mr. Strange.
The Senate Republican campaign arm, which Mr. McConnell effectively oversees, withdrew Friday from a joint fund-raising agreement with Mr. Moore’s campaign. And Senators Mike Lee of Utah and Steve Daines of Montana rescinded their endorsements of the candidate.
The frenzy reflected not just the worry over the Senate seat once held by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general, but also the broader danger of the Republican Party’s being associated with Mr. Moore.
If Doug Jones, the Democratic nominee, wins next month, Mr. McConnell’s majority will shrink to one, possibly imperiling the Republican push to overhaul the tax code and most everything else that lawmakers are aiming to do to reverse their spiral before the midterm elections. It could also raise at least the potential that Democrats could seize control of the Senate in 2018, by holding all of their endangered seats and winning Republican seats in Nevada and Arizona.
But if Mr. Moore wins, the party faces a potentially more untenable prospect: welcoming a child-molesting suspect into their ranks, a move that every Republican candidate would have to answer for. That raised memories of Todd Akin, the Republican Senate candidate who in 2012 said victims of “legitimate rape” rarely got pregnant, an assertion that Democrats hung around every candidate that year.
And Mr. Moore’s interview within the sympathetic confines of Mr. Hannity’s show, which was also an initial safe harbor for Mr. Akin in 2012, made Republicans in the capital only more determined that he had to step aside.
“I don’t remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother,” Mr. Moore told Mr. Hannity. Asked by Mr. Hannity if he ever dated teenagers when he was in his 30s, Mr. Moore equivocated, replying, “Not generally, no.”
Some Senate Republicans have encouraged Mr. Strange — who lost to Mr. Moore in a bitterly contested Republican runoff election in September — to run as a write-in candidate, an option Mr. Strange is considering, according to Republicans who have spoken with him. But some Republicans believe he would do little more than play spoiler, ensuring either that Mr. Moore is elected by taking votes Mr. Jones would otherwise get or that the Democrat wins by siphoning support from Mr. Moore among Republicans seeking a palatable third option.
Mr. McConnell and Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, spoke with Mr. Strange about the prospect immediately after the Moore news broke on Thursday, according to Republicans familiar with the conversation. And Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who won re-election in 2010 as a write-in candidate, was planning to discuss logistics with Mr. Strange this weekend.
Asked Friday if he thought Mr. Strange should run as a write-in candidate, Mr. McConnell said only that “you’d have to ask Luther what his intentions are, given this development.”
Republicans in Washington and Alabama have also approached other potential candidates about a write-in effort, including Representative Robert B. Aderholt, a mainstream conservative from northern Alabama. But it is unclear that any prominent Republican will be willing to mount a wild-card campaign for the Senate unless Mr. Moore stands down first.
Absent Mr. Moore’s cooperation, Republicans in Washington have conferred with election lawyers to explore other long-shot options for replacing or marginalizing him, several of which would probably lead to a clash in court with Mr. Moore and his supporters.
One approach that Republicans are considering, according to people briefed on the deliberations, would involve asking Gov. Kay Ivey to order a new date for the election — sometime early next year — and giving the party time to ease Mr. Moore from the race.
Alabama election law requires candidates to withdraw at least 76 days before an election in order to be replaced on the ballot, a deadline Mr. Moore has already missed.
State law gives the governor broad authority to set the date of special elections, and Ms. Ivey, who is a Republican, already rescheduled the Senate election once, after inheriting the governor’s office in April when her predecessor, Robert Bentley, resigned in a sex and corruption scandal. Ms. Ivey’s advisers have not ruled out exercising that power again, according to Republicans in touch with her camp, but she has signaled that she would like reassurances of support from the White House before taking such an aggressive step.
Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist close to Mr. McConnell, said presidential intervention was needed to bring any order to the situation in Alabama. He suggested that President Trump could personally nudge Mr. Moore out of the race and back a write-in campaign by Mr. Strange, or perhaps Mr. Sessions, a popular figure with Alabama Republicans.
“You’ve got a wild-card politician, who may or may not support your agenda, who’s now got horrific allegations of molestation of a child,” Mr. Jennings said, referring to Mr. Moore. “It strikes me that the people of Alabama would listen to the president.”
A spokesman for Ms. Ivey did not reply to an email asking about her intentions, but she has been in contact with Nick Ayers, Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, according to Republican officials.
But there is no apparent precedent for rescheduling an election so close to the planned vote, Republicans acknowledged. In addition to state election laws, such an extreme step could also run afoul of federal voting rights law.
Then there is the possibility that if Mr. Moore stayed in the race and won, the members of the Senate would deny him a seat.
While sidestepping a question about whether he would support such an extraordinary step, Mr. McConnell recalled how, as a relatively junior senator, he pushed to oust Senator Bob Packwood, Republican of Oregon, a long-serving and powerful figure, after a throng of women came forward to accuse Mr. Packwood of sexually harassing or abusing them.
“I ended up making a motion to expel the chairman of the Finance Committee of my own party, which was approved unanimously, and he subsequently resigned,” Mr. McConnell said. “So character does count in America and in the United States Senate.”
While maintaining his typically stoic public face, Mr. McConnell was said to be highly irritated that, after he had fended off problematic candidates in recent years, Mr. Moore had instantly revived the type of difficulties Republicans suffered with Mr. Akin and other hard-liners.
But in Alabama, Republicans appeared far more willing to give Mr. Moore the benefit of the doubt.
“Let’s let this thing work out,” said Trip Pittman, a state senator. “You’re innocent until proven otherwise.”
Mr. Pittman urged Mr. Moore to aggressively rebut the claims. That, he said, would be “really helpful.”
Alabama’s congressional Republicans remained silent on Friday, wanting to see how emphatically Mr. Moore responded to the charges, but there were conversations about eventually issuing a joint statement. Some of them were rattled — and not just because of the Moore story.
As members of the state’s House delegation arrived Thursday in Birmingham, Ala., for a fund-raiser with Speaker Paul D. Ryan, there were hydraulic problems with the plane as it touched down. Shortly after enduring a bumpy landing, their phones lit up to reveal The Post’s report.
For their part, Democrats appear to be ready to join the fray. The party had been holding back, in part out of fear that getting involved could nationalize the election and compromise Mr. Jones’s brand as an independent-minded local candidate.
But on Friday, Democratic donors appeared increasingly interested in the race. Stephen J. Cloobeck, a Nevada hotel magnate who contributed $500,000 last year to a Senate-focused Democratic “super PAC,” described Mr. Moore as “despicable” and said he would gladly direct money to Mr. Jones.
“If there’s an event, I will participate, because I have a 14-year-old little girl, and if anyone touched her, I’d kill them,” Mr. Cloobeck said. “I’d kill them.”
