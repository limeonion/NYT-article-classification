2017: Our Reporters Reflect on Covering Washington and Politics - The New York Times
It would be an understatement to say that 2017 was one of the most exciting years in American politics in decades.

Throughout the year, our reporters, photographers and editors shared their reflections with Times Insider on how they covered some of the biggest stories — and some of the more modest scoops, as well. Here is a collection of those tales and our journalists’ recounting of how they unfolded.
