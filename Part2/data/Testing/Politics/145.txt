Trump Hires Veteran Lawyer With Deep Experience in Washington - The New York Times
President Trump has added John Dowd, a veteran lawyer in Washington, to his legal team in the face of investigations related to Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as well as possible obstruction of justice in the firing of the James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director.
Mr. Dowd led the damning Major League Baseball investigation of gambling allegations involving the former Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose during the late 1980s. He also represented Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, in the so-called “Keating Five” scandal in which Mr. McCain was ultimately exonerated in 1991 after being accused of improperly meeting with federal bank regulators on behalf of a campaign contributor.
“He’s a legend on both sides of the field, both as a prosecutor and as a defense lawyer,” Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Mr. Trump’s legal team, said Friday. “When John Dowd speaks, everybody listens.”
It is likely that Mr. Trump will hire additional lawyers to his legal team. But Mr. Dowd is the highest-powered Washington presence on the team so far.
Mr. Trump has put his longtime personal lawyer, Marc E. Kasowitz, in charge of his private legal advisers. He has also retained Jay Sekulow, who has been the face of the legal team on television shows.
Mr. Kasowitz is well known on Wall Street and in Manhattan business circles, although his firm became a force in New York after beginning as a scrappy upstart. But several of Mr. Trump’s advisers have quietly complained that Mr. Kasowitz lacks the knowledge of Washington to properly grapple with Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who was appointed by the Department of Justice.
Last week, after the widely watched Senate testimony of Mr. Comey detailing the circumstances of his firing — and the interactions he had with Mr. Trump that the former F.B.I. director said he believed had led to it — Mr. Kasowitz responded with a hastily drafted statement that included typos, including misspelling the word “president.” His performance to reporters at the National Press Club in Washington pleased the president and some senior advisers, but underwhelmed many of Mr. Trump’s aides.
Mr. Dowd, by contrast, is a longtime insider of Washington’s legal circles.
In private practice, he also represented a Justice Department aide in 2007 during a furor over what was widely viewed as a political purge of eight United States attorneys during President George W. Bush’s administration.
Mr. Dowd had previously worked as a federal prosecutor at the Justice Department’s tax division and on organized-crime cases.
