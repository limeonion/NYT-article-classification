Trump Attacks Obama, and His Own Attorney General, Over Russia Inquiry - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — President Trump attacked his own attorney general on Wednesday, asking in a Twitter post why Jeff Sessions has not been investigating Democrats for Russian interference in the 2016 election.
In his tweet, Mr. Trump revived his offensive on Mr. Sessions, whom he once called “beleaguered,” and continued his days-long Twitter comments on the ongoing special counsel’s investigation into Russian meddling. It was the latest instance of the president publicly criticizing federal law enforcement.
Mr. Trump has been questioning why the Obama administration did not do more to stop Russian interference, and he has said that his administration has been tougher on Russia than that of his predecessor.
“Why aren’t they the subject of the investigation?” Mr. Trump asked. The president regularly uses Twitter to question why the Justice Department is not investigating his political opponents.
Mr. Trump has denied that Russia was involved in the 2016 election meddling. But an indictment announced last week against 13 Russians and three companies described a sophisticated, multiyear Russian influence campaign designed to sow discord across the American democratic process. On Tuesday, the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, announced charges against the 19th person in the sprawling probe that has dogged Mr. Trump’s presidency.
Mr. Trump does not think Mr. Sessions — one of his earliest supporters — has done enough to protect him from the Russia probe. The president has publicly said he never would have hired Mr. Sessions if he knew the attorney general would recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
The attorney general’s recusal last year was the first in a series of steps that led to Mr. Mueller’s appointment. Mr. Trump had once considered firing Mr. Mueller, but he backed down after the objection of a senior adviser.
In recent months, Mr. Trump has become more critical of federal law enforcement and has called senior officials at the F.B.I. biased against him.
