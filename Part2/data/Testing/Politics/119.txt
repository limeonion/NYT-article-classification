Comey’s Firing May Imperil Republicans’ Legislative Agenda - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — President Trump’s stunning firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, injected another volatile ingredient into the partisanship already engulfing the capital and threatened to overwhelm Republican efforts to convert their government control into legislative success.
The decision to oust Mr. Comey also increased the prospect of another confirmation fight in the Senate, as Mr. Trump promised to move quickly to replace Mr. Comey, who had overseen the inquiry into Russian meddling in the election. And the White House’s handling of the dismissal — and apparent failure to anticipate the severe backlash it would generate — renewed questions about the competence of administration officials and their ability to navigate Washington.
After the House finally managed to pass a Republican health care proposal last week, divisive as it was, congressional Republicans suddenly found themselves trying to explain how Mr. Trump was within his rights in jettisoning Mr. Comey. Democrats quickly coalesced around a push for a special prosecutor to take control of the Russia inquiry, saying the leadership of the Justice Department could not be trusted with the job after the termination of the F.B.I. chief on what they considered spurious grounds.
“Clearly, the time is now for an independent prosecutor,” Senator Christopher Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, said Wednesday. “The Senate, designed by the founding fathers as the guardian of democratic norms, must now rise to meet the gravity of this moment.”
To emphasize that gravity, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, summoned his colleagues to sit at their desks as the Senate convened Wednesday morning to take in whatever the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, had to say about the firing.
Mr. Schumer also requested that Mr. McConnell call a closed-door and possibly classified all-senators briefing with top Justice Department officials on the state of the investigation. Such a session could underscore what Democrats view as the seriousness of the president’s decision and give senators in both parties a private opportunity to confront their differences.
But if Democrats were hoping that the uproar surrounding the firing was going to push Mr. McConnell in their direction, they were badly mistaken.
Although other senior Republicans expressed some misgivings about the firing, the majority leader showed no sign of budging or joining the call for a special prosecutor. Instead, he said that any new investigation would only impede current inquiries being conducted by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees and the F.B.I. He also noted that Democrats, including Mr. Schumer himself, had made clear their dissatisfaction with Mr. Comey over the inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s email practices during the presidential campaign.
“This is what we have now,” Mr. McConnell said: “our Democratic colleagues complaining about the removal of an F.B.I. director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized.”
Mr. McConnell also issued a veiled warning to Democrats, who are likely to try to use the confirmation hearing for a new F.B.I. director to air their grievances about the firing and push for a special prosecutor if one is not in place by then. He said Senate Republicans anticipated a “full, fair and timely” confirmation of the person selected by Mr. Trump to take over the agency.
But Democrats were already setting the stage for a confirmation showdown. “The Senate must stand firm,” Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, wrote in a post on Twitter. “We will only confirm an FBI Director who pledges a vigorous investigation of Russian interference & connections.”
Despite Mr. McConnell’s efforts to move past the firing, Democrats and some Republicans are going to be unwilling to do so. The bipartisan leadership of the Senate Intelligence Committee invited Mr. Comey to testify next week, and on Wednesday, Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, was among those in the president’s party challenging the White House’s explanation.
“Given the timing and circumstances of the decision, I believe the White House should provide a fuller explanation regarding the president’s rationale,” he said.
Democrats view this as an opportunity to force the appointment of a special prosecutor, which they have sought since serious questions were first raised about Russian meddling in the election. They have, at least for the moment, relegated their push for a special congressional committee or independent commission to the back burner.
Though most Republicans continued to oppose the idea of a special prosecutor, some small cracks in the resistance gave Democrats hope that they could prevail while, at a minimum, forcing Republicans to defend their opposition to the public.
The tension over Mr. Comey is certain to spill into other issues and could make it harder for Republicans to maintain the unity they need if lawmakers are leery of the president. As if on cue, they suffered an embarrassing defeat on an attempt to roll back an Obama administration environmental rule on Wednesday when three Senate Republicans broke with the party. The fight is also likely to color the coming consideration of Mr. Trump’s nominees to the federal bench: The White House announced a slate of conservative judges this week, and this is one area where it could have some success. There could also be an impact on the administration’s emerging plan for major tax cuts.
All in all, the firing turned Washington on its head and resurrected a sense of administration scandals past, with their drumbeat of calls for special prosecutors and swirling questions about exactly who did what when.
Though Democrats can keep public pressure on Republicans, their minority status limits their ability to force action. They can slow the Senate to a crawl, as they tried to do Wednesday by refusing to give consent to holding a daylong slate of hearings. But changes in Senate practices instituted by Democrats in 2013 mean that a new F.B.I. director can ultimately be put in office on a straight majority vote.
Still, the firing presented a formidable new distraction for a White House and congressional Republicans struggling badly to deliver on their pledge to enact a conservative agenda. They already faced opposition Democrats with little trust in the president’s motives or intentions. The sudden departure of Mr. Comey made a bad situation much worse.
