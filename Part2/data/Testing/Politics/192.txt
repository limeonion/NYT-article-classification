How the Left and the Right Reacted to John Bolton as National Security Adviser - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — President Trump announced on Thursday the swift substitution of his national security adviser: Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, the battle-tested, three-star Army general, is resigning and will be replaced by John R. Bolton, the former American ambassador to the United Nations.
Mr. Bolton, who was considered a hawk among hawks in President George W. Bush’s administration, had a history of incendiary comments that primed him to be a commentator on Fox News. There, he impressed Mr. Trump with his muscular version of American power.
News that Mr. Bolton would become Mr. Trump’s third national security adviser — after General McMaster and Michael T. Flynn — was met with immediate acclaim and criticism.
Here’s a look at how political figures and lawmakers on the right and the left reacted.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida
Representative Lee Zeldin of New York

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader
