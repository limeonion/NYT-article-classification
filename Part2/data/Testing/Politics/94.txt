F.B.I. Agents Supported Comey, Surveys Show, Weakening Trump’s Claim of Turmoil - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — As F.B.I. director, James B. Comey had widespread support from his agents, according to internal survey data released Wednesday that contradicts President Trump’s claim that he fired Mr. Comey in part because agents had lost confidence in him.
Mr. Comey’s firing is among many topics now under investigation by the Justice Department special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Trump and his aides have offered changing explanations for why he fired Mr. Comey, who was overseeing the investigation into Mr. Trump’s associates and possible links to Russia’s election interference.
The F.B.I. released the results of three years of internal questionnaires in response to a public records request by The New York Times. The surveys revealed that agents around the country gave the F.B.I. leadership high marks — 4.01 on a scale of 5 — in this year’s survey. The F.B.I. considers scores over 3.81 an indication of success.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly cast Mr. Comey in a negative light.
“He’s a showboat, he’s a grandstander, the F.B.I. has been in turmoil,” Mr. Trump said of Mr. Comey in an NBC interview in May. “You know that. I know that. Everybody knows that. You take a look at the F.B.I. a year ago, it was in virtual turmoil, less than a year ago. It hasn’t recovered from that.”
The F.B.I. surveys show no support for that claim. They scored him above 4 as both an inspiring leader and someone more interested in leading than being liked. His direct subordinates rated him 4.48 on the question of whether they would work with him again.
While Mr. Comey’s marks fell slightly in some categories over his three-year tenure, his scores were consistently high in each year and in nearly every area. Nationwide, agents gave higher marks to Mr. Comey’s leadership team in 2017 than they gave to Mr. Mueller, who preceded him as director and whose tenure is widely respected.
The latest batch of surveys was conducted in March, months after Mr. Comey was widely criticized for speaking publicly in July 2016 and again in October about the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server. His former deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, has testified that Mr. Comey had not lost the support of his agents.
Mr. Trump originally said he fired Mr. Comey on the recommendation of the Justice Department, which criticized his handling of the investigation into Mrs. Clinton. The White House then said that the F.B.I. was in turmoil, and the president said he was thinking about the Russia investigation when he fired his F.B.I. director.
In a congressional hearing, Mr. Comey called Mr. Trump’s characterization of morale at the F.B.I. a lie. He had no comment Wednesday.
Mr. Comey viewed the surveys as an important tool in assessing his management corps. Low scores were highlighted in red on the reports, prompting a saying at the F.B.I.: “Red is dead.”
“For those leaders whose surveys are covered in red, we need to quickly find a path to improvement, or we need to get them out of the role,” Mr. Comey wrote in an email to staff in 2015.
Mr. Comey, in memos on his meetings with Mr. Trump, said the president repeatedly asked him to say publicly that he was not under investigation. Mr. Comey refused. He said Mr. Trump privately asked him to end an investigation into the former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn. Mr. Trump has denied that.
The Justice Department is investigating whether Mr. Comey’s firing amounted to obstruction. Mr. Mueller has requested documents from the White House related to his firing and has said he intends to interview West Wing officials about it.
The high marks for Mr. Comey’s leadership team also reflect well on Mr. McCabe, who has also been the subject of Mr. Trump’s sharp criticism. Mr. McCabe’s wife, a Democrat, ran unsuccessfully for Virginia State Senate and received donations from a political action committee run by Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime ally of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Trump took the unusual step of publicly calling for Mr. McCabe to be fired while he was serving as acting F.B.I. director.
