Without Obama as a Unifier, Republicans Are Fragmented - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — A Republican-only attempt in the Senate to repeal the health care law is limping along, hobbled by giant divisions within the party over how to deal with Medicaid, among other issues.
President Trump says a tax bill is winding its way through Capitol Hill, but no such measure is even close to being drafted.
Prospects for fixing the nation’s infrastructure seem gloomy, in no small part because Mr. Trump wants to do so without Democrats, again, which Senate Republicans say won’t work.
Six months after Republicans seized total control of Washington, the Republican agenda is not so much stalled as it is still sitting in the lot with the price sticker firmly attached, but with no apparent buyers.
“I think every day we’re talking about a tweet that is off message, it is a bad thing,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, in gentle criticism of the president’s almost daily, sometimes hourly, habit. But, he said, “we bear blame.”
As it turns out, President Barack Obama’s rejection of a Republican agenda served, in many ways, as a convenient foil for Republicans, cloaking their vast internal disagreements over health care, taxes, trade and other issues.
“The irony is, for years, they said it’s our fault, it’s our fault,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, a moderate who said she had been waiting for the White House to try to woo her on something, anything. “It’s not Democrats who are their problem. It’s just them.”
Republicans have also been stymied by Mr. Trump, who has at turns undermined their efforts to push through his agenda and distracted from it with crises largely of his making.
This week, Marc Short, Mr. Trump’s liaison on Capitol Hill, told reporters that the firing of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and investigations into Russia’s involvement in the election had made it difficult for the White House to focus on its legislative agenda.
A president rarely has as much capital as he does in the first six months, as Mr. Obama realized when he plowed through major legislation like an $830 billion stimulus bill, an expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program and legislation to empower women to sue over unequal pay. But Mr. Trump now finds himself like a rookie poker player at the high-stakes table at the Venetian hotel, short on both momentum and chips.
The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, stepped to the lectern on Tuesday to recite what he framed as a litany of successes for Mr. Trump, but as they say in politics, when you’re explaining, you’re probably losing.
Congressional Republicans made the internal deal that they would endure the embarrassments and foibles of Mr. Trump to get their party’s agenda underway, and now find themselves with roughly 30 days left before the August recess, with only a Supreme Court confirmation to show for it.
In those 30 days, the Senate has promised a vote on a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, whether they have a majority or not. The House and Senate are supposed to produce and then pass budget blueprints for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, then reconcile their differences and vote again. And the Treasury Department has said members of Congress must raise the government’s statutory borrowing limit before they leave for the summer.
Many Republicans seem leery of continuing to use procedural methods to shut Democrats out of legislation. Already, they have tried to finesse the difficult task of passing health care legislation through the budget rule, devised in 1974 to ease tough votes to control the deficit. They have vowed to use it again to ram through the first thorough rewrite of the tax code since 1986. Now, the Trump administration has raised the idea of using the same method to pass an infrastructure bill — the one Trump proposal that was supposed to have bipartisan appeal — with a simple majority.
“If we can’t do 60 votes on infrastructure, we probably couldn’t do 60 votes on anything,” said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, referring to the minimum number of senators needed these days to pass a bill, and one that would have to include Democrats.
Democrats, and some Republicans, argue that Republicans’ years of opposition cauterized their mind-set toward legislating. “The hard right, which has disproportionate influence in their conference, has meant they are very good at the negative and not so much the positive,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.
Discord within the party has become even clearer as lawmaking has moved to the Senate, where Republicans range from ardent conservatives — who, like their party mates in the House, loathe government involvement in health care and embrace free trade — to those from blue or moderate states where the health care law is popular and trade is viewed as a proxy for job loss. Some senators share Mr. Trump’s dim view of immigrants, while others come from states where they are vital elements of the agriculture industry.
House Republicans favor a proposal to tax imports instead of exports, while Senate Republicans largely dislike the idea. The most conservative and the most moderate Republicans have shown themselves happy to stand up to each other — and at times the Trump administration — on proposals they dislike, from one to unravel the Medicaid program to a taxpayer-funded wall along the border. Senator Dean Heller of Nevada, perhaps the most endangered Republican up for re-election in 2018, has decided to wage his campaign solely on opposing Mr. Trump’s efforts to revive a nuclear waste dump in his state.
“The Republican conference isn’t a monolith,” said Representative Trey Gowdy, Republican of South Carolina. “So there are genuinely different perspectives. The fundamental question remains: How much of what one is seeking is sufficient to accept? Losing is unifying. Trying to achieve a majority is unifying.”
Republicans have papered over their differences for years in the context of their unity in opposing Mr. Obama and Democrats generally, making lofty promises to reverse Democratic policies. But while they have been able to undo many regulations, they have found reality far more difficult on the complex issues of taxes and health care.
“Too often, we overpromise and underperform,” Mr. Gowdy said. “Health care and tax reform have always been complicated. This isn’t a new development. It’s impossibly complicated when there is no consensus on the path forward other than to wait on others to make proposals and then criticize those proposals as inadequate and insufficiently conservative.”
