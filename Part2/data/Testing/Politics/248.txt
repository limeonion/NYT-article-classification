Right and Left: Partisan Writing You Shouldn’t Miss - The New York Times
The political news cycle is fast, and keeping up can be overwhelming. Trying to find differing perspectives worth your time is even harder. That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and the left that you might not have seen.

• David Harsanyi in The Federalist:
“You don’t trust Donald Trump to name an F.B.I. director, even though it’s within his purview to do so? Well, I don’t trust Barack Obama to enter into faux treaties with a bunch of nations without Senate approval.”
Although David Harsanyi doesn’t believe we’re in a constitutional crisis (yet), he’s willing to be open to the “worst case scenario,” and thus he backs an independent prosecutor to cover the Russia investigation. However, he would like to use this episode to remind his readers of the importance of checks and balances, regardless of which party occupies the executive branch. Read more »

• Jonathan S. Tobin in National Review:
“The last thing the country needs is another out-of-control probe that won’t give us the answers we need about Russia and Trump.”
Jonathan Tobin explains why, historically, the appointment of a special prosecutor is a bad choice. Noting that special prosecutors tend to become “attached to the extraordinary power they’ve been given,” Mr. Tobin argues that “their investigation becomes not a means to the end for which they were purposed, but an end in itself.” If we really want to get to the bottom of any ties between the president, his orbit and Russia, a “bipartisan special commission or joint congressional committee” would be much more effective.

• Seth Mandel on Twitter:
“Don’t indulge pure conspiracy theorism. But also don’t just wave it all away dismissively. Dems aren’t imagining all this.”
Not all partisan writing worth your time is found in article form. Sometimes, a series of tweets — brief but thoughtful — do the trick. Seth Mandel, an opinion editor for The New York Post, deploys 12 140-character missives to speak to his Republican friends who feel inclined to dismiss the left’s reaction to Mr. Comey’s firing: What if the shoe were on the other foot?

• Jeet Heer in The New Republic:
“Social movements like the Resistance are the performance-enhancing drugs of politics: They can help a party win, but they also fuel its rage and hamper its ability to think clearly.”
Jeet Heer charts the inchoate history of the Resistance, the movement that sprang up in opposition to both the president and, as Mr. Heer argues, the Democratic Party itself. Looking forward, he urges Democratic leaders to embrace the movement, lest it go the way of Occupy Wall Street. Read more »

• Maya Binyam in The New Inquiry:
“It bears repeating that Donald Trump’s ascendance is not peaceful.” 
Fact- and spell-checking the president, along with other types enforcement of political decorum, are misguided attempts by “certain white liberals” to return to a fantasy of a state characterized by decency — one in which efficiency and decorum are privileged over actual policy. Maya Binyam urges her readers to dispense with notions of the “presidential” and not mistake propriety for the balm that can heal a deeply damaged nation. Read more »

• Amanda Marcotte in Salon:
“The more we know about how Americans really live today, the harder it is for Republicans to enact a backward-looking conservative agenda. No wonder they are trying to kneecap the Census Bureau’s ability to do its job.”
On the same day that the president fired Mr. Comey, John H. Thompson, the director of the Census Bureau, announced that he was stepping down. This departure, though not nearly as high profile as that of the F.B.I. director, should worry people, argues Amanda Marcotte. Read more »

• Conor Friedersdorf in The Atlantic:
“If you’re not worried about F.B.I. Director James Comey getting fired, this man might change your mind.”
If you don’t believe Conor Friedersdorf, a self-proclaimed civil libertarian, that the president’s dismissal of the F.B.I. chief is truly frightening, perhaps you’ll believe a man that Mr. Friedersdorf disagrees with on almost every issue: Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the editor of the Lawfare blog. As Mr. Friedersdorf describes him, Mr. Wittes “is as informed as anyone about the workings of the national-security bureaucracy and federal law enforcement. And his predisposition is nearly always to trust it.” That’s why if even Mr. Wittes is worried, you should be too. Read more »

• The Economist:
“Trumponomics is a poor recipe for long-term prosperity. America will end up more indebted and more unequal.”
On the heels of an interview with the president (which you can read here), The Economist lays out a blistering critique of his economic plan. To be more precise, the magazine’s writers critique what is better called a “business wishlist”; they see nothing that can be cogently recognized as an economic doctrine. “It is best seen as a set of proposals put together by businessmen courtiers for their king,” they write. And while his fiscal policies may yield short-term gains for the country, President Trump’s economic nationalism “poses dangers to America and the world.” Read more »

• Caity Weaver in GQ:
“In a moment of political ridiculousness, there’s even the suddenly not ridiculous question of whether Dwayne Johnson might actually be headed for Washington.”
It’s been a rough week. Finish it off by entertaining the fantasy that the impossibly affable, sincerely compassionate former wrestler and voice behind your children’s favorite animated movie might one day be president. Read more »
