Clinton and Trump Each Lay Claim to Military Brass - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Both Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton have their favorite retired general.
For Mr. Trump, it is Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a retired Army officer who led the Defense Intelligence Agency. For Mrs. Clinton, it is Gen. John R. Allen, a retired Marine who commanded NATO forces in Afghanistan.
Both men gave rousing speeches endorsing their candidate at the national conventions in July. Some of their peers, however, bridled at the outspokenness, saying they were politicizing the military.
Most notably, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, who retired last fall as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote in The Washington Post: “The military is not a political prize. Politicians should take the advice of senior military leaders but keep them off the stage.”
Even so, both campaigns this week released the names of scores of retired admirals and generals, many with exemplary service records, who offered endorsements. These lists have become a somewhat expected part of the presidential campaign, an effort to bolster a candidate’s credentials as commander in chief.
Nonetheless, some military experts say the endorsements of retired officers are overrated. “Few Americans are likely to care about which candidate retired generals support for president,” said Andrew J. Bacevich, a military historian and retired Army colonel.
Here is an assessment of some of those names.
Many of the senior officers from both sides are veterans of the Vietnam War, as well as of more recent conflicts.
Of Mrs. Clinton’s supporters, General Allen is also former deputy commander of the Central Command. Gen. Wesley K. Clark, a former NATO military commander who oversaw the allied air campaign in Kosovo, is a recipient of the Silver Star.
Among Mr. Trump’s supporters, General Flynn served as a top aide to Gen. Stanley McChrystal in Afghanistan. Gen. Burwell B. Bell III, a retired four-star officer, commanded United States forces in South Korea.
One supporter of Mr. Trump, Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, a former commander of the Army’s elite Delta Force, first caused controversy after the Sept. 11 attacks when, as a senior Pentagon official, he described the fight against terrorism as a Christian battle against Satan. His remarks, made in numerous speeches to church groups, were publicly repudiated by President George W. Bush, who argued that America’s war was not with Islam but with violent fanatics.
In 2004, the Pentagon’s inspector general recommended “corrective action” against General Boykin, concluding that he had violated rules by failing to clear the content of his speeches with security and public affairs personnel, and for failing to make it clear that the views he expressed were his alone, and not those of the Pentagon.
Discussing a 1993 battle by American soldiers against a Muslim warlord in Somalia, General Boykin told an audience: “I knew my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol.”
Another backer of Mr. Trump, Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, the former assistant vice chief of staff of the Air Force, in 2010 supported an Army lieutenant who refused to deploy to Afghanistan because he did not believe President Obama was born in the United States. In an affidavit, General McInerney demanded that Mr. Obama release his birth records.
While only a tiny portion of military officers reach the rank of admiral or general, an even smaller sliver earn three or four stars, senior enough to lead the Pentagon’s regional commands around the globe or their individual service’s combat force within those regional commands.
Fifteen percent of Mr. Trump’s retired officer supporters are among those most senior officers, including Adm. Jerry Johnson, a former vice chief of naval operations.
Mrs. Clinton’s backers include nearly twice that number of highest-ranked officers, including Gen. Lloyd Newton of the Air Force.
Of the 95 retired admirals and generals who have endorsed Mrs. Clinton, about a dozen are women, including Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, an intelligence officer who was the first woman to achieve the rank of three-star general in the United States Army.
Mr. Trump’s list of 88 former senior officers has far fewer, including Rear Adm. Mimi Drew, a former deputy assistant secretary of the Navy.
Over all, the retired officers supporting Mrs. Clinton have served more recently while many of Mr. Trump’s supporters have been retired for decades, suggesting they may be less familiar with the current threats facing the country.
One of Mrs. Clinton’s retired military supporters is Maj. Gen. Antonio M. Taguba, a senior Army investigator whose searing report into the abuses of detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq was a catalyst for the broader examination of the torture of prisoners in the hands of American captors.
While the United States has ended “enhanced interrogation” techniques such as waterboarding, Mr. Trump has called for reinstating its use against Islamic State militants, saying: “I like it a lot. I don’t think it’s tough enough.”
One of Mr. Trump’s retired supporters, Rear Adm. Philip Anselmo, told NPR’s “Morning Edition” on Wednesday that “I do believe that things like potentially waterboarding or other efforts that are along those lines are necessary when you’re in combat to save critical lives.”
