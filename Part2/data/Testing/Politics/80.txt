Justice Department Keeps For-Profit Prisons, Scrapping an Obama Plan - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said Thursday that it would continue to use private, for-profit prisons to house thousands of federal inmates, scrapping an Obama administration plan to phase them out because of problems.
It was the second time in two days that the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era policy. On Wednesday, it rescinded a directive that gave anti-discrimination protection to transgender students and allowed them to use the bathroom of their choice.
In a memo released on Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed federal prison officials to keep using the private prisons. He also withdrew a policy set out last August by Sally Q. Yates, then the deputy attorney general, who had ordered prison officials to phase out the use of the private facilities.
Ms. Yates’s order had followed a report from the Justice Department inspector general about safety and security concerns with the operations at private prisons, along with other issues. The private prisons “compare poorly to our own bureau facilities” in a number of areas and do not save much money, Ms. Yates wrote as she ordered them phased out.
Mr. Sessions, in withdrawing her order, said the Yates directive had “changed longstanding policy and practice” and hurt the prison system’s ability “to meet the future needs” for housing.
President Trump fired Ms. Yates as acting attorney general last month over an unrelated matter, when she refused to defend the ban he had ordered on travelers from seven largely Muslim countries. The courts have blocked the travel ban, and the administration is rewriting it.
