• Rush Limbaugh:
“But it’s also kind of, you know, a little bit discomforting, unseemly for Trump to go after such a loyal supporter this way.”
On his radio program, Mr. Limbaugh responded to the rumors that President Trump was thinking about dismissing his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, a man who Mr. Limbaugh points out was an early and ardent supporter of the president during the campaign. Mr. Limbaugh reacts the way other defenders of Mr. Sessions have in recent days, arguing that “Sessions is the kind of man Trump needs in his administration.” Read more »

• Lucy Steigerwald in The American Conservative:
“Since when is the U.S. justice system more about restitution than punishment?”
Last week, Mr. Sessions announced that civil asset forfeiture was back, and writers from the left and the right recoiled. Ms. Steigerwald, who writes from a libertarian perspective, outlines her objections to what Mr. Sessions has called a “key tool” for law enforcement. She explains how the policy’s “fundamental problem” is that it allows the police to seize property from people who have not yet been convicted or charged with a crime. Read more »

• Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review:
“Sessions erred in the rashness and overbreadth of his recusal from the Russia investigation, but the president has himself to blame for the appointment of a special counsel.”
Mr. McCarthy agrees with the president that Mr. Sessions’s recusal was premature and overly broad, but that’s where the agreement ends. Mr. Trump’s mishandling of James B. Comey’s ouster as F.B.I. director, along with his decision to appoint Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, were ultimately two decisions that have led the president to his current predicament. Moreover, Mr. McCarthy notes that Mr. Rosenstein may have political reasons to give Robert Mueller’s investigation “limitless jurisdiction.” Read more »

• George Beebe in The National Interest:
“Powerful forces in both Russia and the United States appear to be itching for a fight.”
Mr. Beebe is worried about what happens when an “under-staffed, under-experienced, and under-managed presidency” is confronted with “domestic opponents” determined to draw the worst picture of Russian actions and intentions. Hoping that “cooler heads prevail” in what might turn out to be a rehashing of Cold War hostility, he explains, “Each side has legitimate grievances against the other, but each also suffers from serious misperceptions of the other’s intentions.” Read more »

• Leon Neyfakh in Slate:
“In declaring his warm support for civil forfeiture, the attorney general practically dared his detractors to look into his soul and wonder: Does he think this is a good, fair idea, or is he just pretending because it serves some broader agenda?”
Mr. Neyfakh points out that critics of the civil forfeiture policy can be found on the right and left. In theory, it is “a clever and morally righteous idea,” but in practice, it “shakes down innocent people.” Mr. Neyfakh proposes that the only way to explain Mr. Sessions’s reinstatement of such a broadly condemned program is to understand the attorney general’s distinct worldview: “a worldview that treats all police officers as righteous agents of order and all suspects as presumptively deserving of punishment.” Read more »

• Greg Sargent in The Washington Post:
“Kushner’s statement takes exceptional care to separate him, with scalpel-like precision, from the now-notorious meeting that Trump Jr. arranged with a Russian lawyer.”
Many on the left spent Monday closely parsing the statement provided by Jared Kushner to Senate investigators. In his op-ed, Mr. Sargent teases out a theme that he sees recurring throughout the statement: the willingness of the president’s son-in-law to throw the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., “under the bus.” Read more »

• Zack Beauchamp in Vox:
“Shady behavior is still shady no matter how good the lawyers — and even Kushner’s very precise defense of his actions raises big new questions for the Trump-Russia scandal.”
Though he admires the careful construction of Mr. Kushner’s statement — “the whole thing reads like it was put together by a very talented legal team” — Mr. Beauchamp argues that this defense raises more questions than it answers. By putting forward “very specific factual assertions, many of which can be easily checked by reporters and federal investigators,” Mr. Kushner is ensuring that scrutiny of his ties to Russia will continue.

• Ed Pilkington in The Guardian:
“The 36-year-old husband of Ivanka Trump might have dug himself deeper into a hole by leaning so heavily on personal ignorance as the core of his defense.”
If we are to believe Mr. Kushner’s version of events, writes Mr. Pilkington, then the American public has a right to be concerned about the naïveté and lack of understanding displayed by the president’s senior adviser. The statement raises questions, he argues, “about how the U.S. president could have entrusted someone with such little foreign policy ballast with a powerful international portfolio.” Read more »

• Joan Vennochi in The Boston Globe:
“Like it or not, the spotlight is on him now, and his voice needs to be heard — under oath.”
Mr. Kushner’s statement is not enough for Ms. Vennochi, who demands nothing short of a “sworn, public testimony” regarding his ties to Russian officials during and after the campaign. Now that we have heard the “rare sound of his voice,” she writes, we should hear him answer questions. Read more »
_____
• Mike Allen in Axios:
“Kushner has a top legal and P.R. team, and the potentially problematic day was deftly handled.”
Mr. Kushner’s written statement and televised remarks got high marks from Mr. Allen, who also notes that “internal reviews” from the White House were strong. However, he adds, “one stage-managed day certainly won’t sate congressional investigators or special counsel Bob Mueller.” Read more »

• Helen Klein Murillo and Steve Vladeck in Lawfare:
“Bold claims from members of Congress notwithstanding, the odds of Sessions facing perjury charges based on the public record to date remain, as a practical matter, at essentially zero.”
Last week, The Washington Post revealed intercepted communications between Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador at the center of so many of the administration’s scandals, and Moscow detailing conversations he had with then-Senator Sessions. Ms. Murillo and Mr. Vladeck, both legal scholars, explore the possibility of a perjury case against Mr. Sessions in light of the report. Though they begin their analysis explaining that perjury is very difficult to prove, they land on this short conclusion: “Big, if true.” Read more »
