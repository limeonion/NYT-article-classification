N.R.A. Chief, Wayne LaPierre, Offers Fierce Defense of 2nd Amendment - The New York Times
OXON HILL, Md. — The head of the National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, leveled a searing indictment on Thursday against liberal Democrats, the news media and political opportunists he said were joined together in a socialist plot to “eradicate all individual freedoms.”
Mr. LaPierre’s remarks, his first since a gunman took the lives of 17 people at a Florida high school last week, seemed aimed at blunting the rising public pressure for stricter gun control. Conservatives, he said, needed to push back even as liberals tried to smear them.
“The shameful politicization of tragedy — it’s a classic strategy, right out of the playbook of a poisonous movement,” he said to a friendly but largely restrained crowd at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. “They hate the N.R.A. They hate the Second Amendment. They hate individual freedom.”
The solution Mr. LaPierre offered was not to pass new laws but to better enforce the existing background check system and, he said, “harden our schools” with more armed guards.
“Evil walks among us,” he added, making a passing reference to “another terrible tragedy” in the Parkland, Fla., school massacre.
Mr. LaPierre’s pugnacious appearance appeared to signal a tactical shift for the N.R.A., which had officially remained mostly quiet in the week after the Florida shooting, even as a movement of young people, including survivors of the massacre, made emotional pleas for gun control. The organization typically uses the first few days after an episode of mass gun violence to lie low before it comes out hard in opposition to any new gun control measures.
“The N.R.A. will not only speak out,” he said, “we will speak out louder and we will speak out stronger than ever before.”
Mr. LaPierre, who for around three decades has been the N.R.A.’s public face of unwavering resistance to tighter restrictions on guns, used his speech to play to the fear and mistrust that many on the right have toward government.
He raised the specter of mass gun confiscation. He accused federal agencies like the Justice Department of weaponizing their power to punish political enemies. He warned darkly that “our country will be changed forever” at the hands of socialist conspirators.
“History proves it. Every time in every nation in which this political disease rises to power, its citizens are repressed, their freedoms are destroyed and their firearms are banned and confiscated,” he said, reading slowly and deliberately from his prepared text.
Mr. LaPierre’s appearance each year at the conference, known as CPAC, is typically an event that passes without much notice. But this year, coming just a week after one of the worst school shootings in American history, CPAC seemed to take on the feel of an N.R.A. forum.
Mr. LaPierre’s name was initially left off the program. Then, on Thursday morning, the conference’s organizers released a revised schedule with both Mr. LaPierre and Dana Loesch, an N.R.A. spokeswoman, added as speakers.
Outside the hall where they spoke, an N.R.A. booth was broadcasting hours of online video programming from its in-house news channel, NRATV, which the organization has used as an early-warning system to alert its followers to gun control efforts.
Ms. Loesch, who just hours earlier had appeared subdued as she spoke softly in defense of the N.R.A. at a contentious forum in Florida hosted by CNN, reverted to the caustic, insult-lobbing persona she has cultivated on NRATV, where she is also a host.
Speaking before Mr. LaPierre, she called for more guns in schools, denounced the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation as political persecutors and accused liberals of trying to sabotage the existing background check system for gun purchases.
Ms. Loesch also blamed James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director fired by President Trump amid a dispute over the bureau’s investigation of possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russians, for indirectly causing the Parkland massacre.
“Maybe if you politicized your agency less and did your job more, we wouldn’t have these problems,” she sneered.
Ms. Loesch also saw fault for the shooting in the news media, saying killings were always good for business. “Many in legacy media love mass shootings,” she said. “Crying white mothers are ratings gold to you and many in the legacy media in the back.”
But the temperature on stage was noticeably hotter than in the audience, which gave Mr. LaPierre and Ms. Loesch polite but mostly unenthusiastic applause.
Mr. LaPierre evidently noticed, prompting him to comment on the stillness in the hall, which he wrote off as fear over the government oppression he warned was coming. “I hear a lot of quiet in this room,” he said. “I sense your anxiety. And you should be anxious. You should be frightened.”
He repeatedly returned to his attacks against gun control advocates as socialists lying in wait.
“And oh how socialists love to make lists,” he said, “especially lists that can be used to deny citizens their basic freedoms.”
The Florida school shooting hung over many of the day’s speeches at CPAC. And with only small exceptions — like when Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, asked for a moment of silence for the victims — speakers directed blame and scorn on the news media.
Ben Shapiro, a conservative podcast host and author, called on reporters to stop showing the faces and printing the names of school shooters, as he said his website had done.
Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said he found much of the news media coverage, including the emotional outpouring at a CNN forum on Wednesday, “tiresome.”
“Every time you see a horrific crime, people in the media and Democratic politicians immediately try to leap on it to advance their agenda,” Mr. Cruz said. “And their agenda is stripping away Second Amendment rights away from law-abiding citizens.”
He noted what he said was one of the biggest moments for applause at the CNN event: “It was about confiscating guns.”
