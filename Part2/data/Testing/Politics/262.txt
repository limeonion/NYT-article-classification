• Guy Benson in Townhall:
“He’s made an excellent, reassuring, conspiracy-puncturing decision here, and that matters. Or at least it should.”
After President Trump fired James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director, Mr. Benson wrote that he would reserve judgment until he saw whom Mr. Trump would nominate as a replacement. Now that Christopher A. Wray, the president’s pick, has testified before the Senate (and received rave reviews from political leaders on both sides of the aisle), Mr. Benson is confident that the fallout from Mr. Comey’s ouster is not as dire as initially predicted.

• Jonathan V. Last in The Weekly Standard:
“However you might feel about a given Trump scandal, ask yourself how you’d feel if it was President Hillary Clinton facing the same challenge.”
Mr. Last urges some Republican self-reflection when he asks his readers to “imagine we’re on an alternate planet where Hillary Clinton won the election and the parties and players are flipped.” He uses this thought experiment to condemn tribalism, which he sees as the “number one disease” afflicting American political culture.

• A. Barton Hinkle in Richmond Times-Dispatch:
“For years, environmentalists have blasted ‘climate science deniers’ for refusing to accept the evidence for human-caused global warming. Is it time we started talking about economic-science deniers, too?”
Mr. Hinkle, who compares the debate over the minimum wage to that of climate change, argues that liberals who reject “economic science” are no better than climate-change deniers. He extends the metaphor, writing, “Different goods and services have different price elasticities, just as different greenhouse gases have different radiative forcing effects.” This does not mean that “just because a small increase has no effect, a big increase will have none, either.” Read more »

• Jackie Gingrich Cushman in Townhall:
“While you might still argue for a more liberal or less liberal immigration policy, you would do well to base that argument on some of these key facts.”
Before one reaches a conclusion about immigration to the United States, Ms. Cushman writes, one must establish a frame of reference based on a few comparative statistics. Using immigration data from around the world, she concludes that “when comparing with other high-population countries, the United States is the world’s most welcoming.” Read more »

• Brian Beutler in New Republic:
“Mitch McConnell is trying to make liars out of Republican opponents of his odious health care bill.”
Mr. Beutler critiques the latest attempt by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to pass a health care bill. The cynicism, he writes, is “breathtaking”: “The proposition is that the most vulnerable citizens should take a flyer on the hope that the least honest governing party in memory will take another vote at some point in the future to spare them.” Read more »

• Charles P. Pierce in Esquire:
“Not Being Corrupt is setting the bar for an FBI director somewhere deep in the planet’s mantle, but these folks will take anything they can get.”
Like Mr. Benson, Mr. Pierce sees a bipartisan consensus arising from Mr. Wray’s confirmation hearing. For Mr. Pierce, however, the consensus is rooted in a cross-party thirst for a return to normalcy. Republicans, he notes, should feel responsible for this disturbance in the political equilibrium.

• Katha Pollitt in The Nation:
“Only women’s rights to contraception and abortion are perpetually debatable, postponable, side-trackable.”
Democratic candidates cannot treat women who support abortion rights as an inessential constituency, Ms. Pollitt argues. While an anti-abortion candidate could potentially garner Democrats a few Republican votes in tough swing elections, the cynical political calculation is not worth it. “Imagine,” she writes, “if Democrats, sick and tired of losing white votes in Mississippi, decided to nominate a segregationist for governor.” Read more »

• Julianne Tveten and Paul Blest in Current Affairs:
“The increasing power of Silicon Valley tech billionaires means the increasing influence of a political philosophy that would be catastrophic for ordinary people.”
Ms. Tveten and Mr. Blest warn against embracing a new class of technologists as the solution to our political problems. Against the backdrop of figures like Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook embarking on a cross-country tour that many have suggested is the prologue to a political campaign, the authors urge their readers not to “underestimate the social harm done by tech capitalism.” Read more »

• Mike Allen in Axios:
“Even our readers who love or feel loyalty to Trump need to remember that it’s just not normal.”
The first six months of the Trump administration have been anything but normal, Mr. Allen writes. He briefly lists 10 norm-defying moments in order to break the country’s tendency to become “inured to the daily whirlwind.” Read more »

• Julia Azari in Mischiefs of Faction:
“The impulse to concentrate a lot of power in the hands of people who don’t know what they’re doing isn’t going to improve American democracy.”
Political amateurs have been enjoying somewhat of a rise in stature lately and, according to Ms. Azari, this is a devastating development for democracy. Expertise and political nuance, she writes, are foundational to democratic governance. Read more »
