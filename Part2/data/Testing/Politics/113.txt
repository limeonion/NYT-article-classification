House Democrat From California Seeks Support to Impeach Trump - The New York Times
WASHINGTON — Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California, circulated a proposed article of impeachment on Monday, the first step in a long-shot attempt to oust President Trump.
Mr. Sherman’s proposed resolution cites the president’s decision to dismiss James B. Comey as F.B.I. director and his attempts to interfere in the investigation of Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, as grounds for a charge of obstruction of justice.
“Donald John Trump has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as president and subversive of constitutional government,” the proposed resolution says.
Mr. Sherman, a liberal Democrat representing the San Fernando Valley and persistent critic of Mr. Trump, circulated his proposed article of impeachment in a letter to colleagues seeking additional support.
The congressman’s efforts to impeach the president, just six months into his term, have virtually no chance of succeeding given the strong majority Republicans hold in the House, where impeachment proceedings must begin.
“Impeachment is not purely a legal issue,” said Elaine Kamarck, a former Clinton administration official who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of “Why Presidents Fail.” “It’s a legal and political issue, and the politics here haven’t gotten to the point of impeachment even though it looks obvious there are several legal cases that can be built.”
Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin and a member of the House Judiciary Committee, condemned Mr. Sherman’s efforts.
“Frustrated opponents of the president are grasping at straws and factitious rumors to advance their own political agenda rather than the interests of the country,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said in an emailed statement. “There is no proof of wrongdoing on the part of the president, which means discussions of impeachment are not only premature, but imprudent and counterproductive.”
While a handful of Democratic lawmakers, including Representative Al Green of Texas, have been pushing for the president’s removal in recent weeks, others in the party have tried to play down calls for impeachment to keep the spotlight on policy issues such as health care.
“The purpose of this article is not to deprive the Republicans of their election victory,” said Mr. Sherman, who is serving his 10th term in Congress. “In fact, from a purely partisan standpoint, it would install someone who would competently pursue a truly regressive progressive,” he added, referring to Vice President Mike Pence.
Mr. Sherman said he had “not received a green or a red light” from the party leadership before he began drafting the proposal. Explaining his urgency in circulating the article of impeachment while investigations continue, Mr. Sherman said the country was not being competently governed.
“Every day that goes by is a day of ‘Alice in Wonderland’ administration,” he said.
