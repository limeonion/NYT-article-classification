• Mr. Comey has figured in some of the biggest news stories of the past year, drawing attention for his decision making during the campaign, his relationship with the White House and his sudden dismissal. Here’s a look at how we got here.
Mr. Trump had shifting positions on Mr. Comey during the campaign — usually in connection to how the director appeared to be handling the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.
For example, when Mr. Comey announced in July that he would not recommend charges against Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Trump reacted on Twitter:
But after Mr. Comey took the unorthodox step just days before the election of announcing that the F.B.I. was reopening the investigation, Mr. Trump said it “took guts.”
Ultimately, Mr. Trump cited Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation as the reason for his firing. In April, The New York Times took an in-depth look at how Mr. Comey tried last year to keep the F.B.I. out of politics, but ended up shaping the election.
This graphic will help you keep them straight:
If it looks as if Mr. Comey is comfortable being publicly grilled by a panel of senators, that’s because he has done it a lot. And he has a reputation for making newsworthy statements during such hearings — when he wants to.
For example, when he testified in March, he confirmed that the F.B.I. was investigating whether members of Mr. Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election. His testimony publicly rebutted Mr. Trump, who had insisted that “Russia is fake news.”
Then, when Mr. Comey testified in early May, just before being fired, he revealed that his decision to reopen the Clinton investigation and the thought that it could have altered the election’s outcome made him “mildly nauseous.”
For days, there was speculation that Mr. Trump might invoke executive privilege and prevent Mr. Comey from testifying, but  White House officials said Monday that the president would not take that step.
Once Mr. Trump was in office, Mr. Comey was summoned to the White House on a January night for dinner, which Mr. Comey recounts in his prepared remarks for Thursday’s testimony. During the one-on-one meal in the Green Room, the president asked for a pledge of loyalty, to no avail.
A few days earlier, Mr. Comey, who has long prided himself on remaining impartial, went so far as to try to blend into the White House drapery during a ceremony with law enforcement officials so that cameras would not capture any interaction that appeared too friendly.
Mr. Comey told a friend that he was unsettled by the president’s attempts to build a personal relationship and by his disregard for protocol when asking about F.B.I. investigations.
A day after Mr. Trump asked him to close the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, Mr. Comey asked Mr. Sessions to never again leave him alone with the president.
The request by the president to close the Flynn investigation has raised questions of obstruction of justice, which are likely to be a topic of discussion on Thursday.
Here’s what you need to know about obstruction of justice.
On May 9, Mr. Comey lost his job in a highly public fashion. He learned about it while giving a speech to agents in Los Angeles. The White House offered a variety of explanations for the firing, starting with the initial reasoning that it was because of Mr. Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation and that he was let go on the recommendation of Mr. Sessions and Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general. Later, however, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he had intended to fire the director before the Justice Department officials had even prepared their recommendation.
Here’s the announcement from the White House about the termination. It includes the memorandum that Mr. Rosenstein compiled with his reasoning, the letter to Mr. Trump from Mr. Sessions recommending the termination, and Mr. Trump’s letter to Mr. Comey.
Then, in an Oval Office meeting with top Russian officials, Mr. Trump said the firing had relieved “great pressure” on him, according to a document summarizing the meeting.
“I just fired the head of the F.B.I.,” Mr. Trump said. “He was crazy, a real nut job.”

Here’s a timeline of how the events unfolded:
And here are some of the contradictory statements that the White House made about the dismissal:
Here are some other names to brush up on for Thursday:
Senators Susan Collins of Maine, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Marco Rubio of Florida — The four Republicans who could have the biggest impact on the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation. The Times’s Carl Hulse wrote about them in his On Washington column, and talked about them on an episode of The Daily. Listen here:
Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia — The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. Mr. Warner, the vice chairman, has said that his work on the committee’s investigation is “probably the most important thing I’ve done in public life.”
Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina — The chairman of the intelligence committee has emerged as the lawmaker who might well be burdened with undermining a president he has vocally supported.
Robert S. Mueller III — The former F.B.I. director was appointed as special counsel to oversee the investigation into Russian interference in the election. He’s respected by members of both parties and is known for his independence.
Jeff Sessions — The attorney general, who offered to resign in recent weeks as he told Mr. Trump he needed the freedom to do his job, previously recused himself from any investigation into charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election.
Rod J. Rosenstein — The deputy attorney general wrote the memo used to fire Mr. Comey and was swiftly embroiled in the controversy.
Michael T. Flynn — He was forced to resign after just 24 days as the national security adviser. He faces a growing set of legal problems over his business dealings with foreign entities and his interactions with federal investigators looking into Russian election meddling.
