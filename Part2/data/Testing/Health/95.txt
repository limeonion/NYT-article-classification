F.D.A. Panel Backs Preventive Use of H.I.V. Drug Truvada - The New York Times
SILVER SPRING, Md. — A drug already used to treat H.I.V. infection should also be approved to prevent it, an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday. The recommendation is the first time that government advisers have advocated giving antiviral medicine to healthy people who might be exposed through sexual activity to the virus that causes AIDS.
One panelist called approving the drug “an amazing opportunity to turn the tide on this epidemic.”
Studies have shown that people who take the medicine, Truvada, every day have a greatly reduced risk of infection.
The F.D.A. usually accepts the advice of its advisory panels, which are made up of outside medical experts.
On Thursday, after evaluating studies of the once-a-day pill and hearing scientific presentations, the panel recommended that Truvada be prescribed for people at high risk of infection, like gay men who have multiple sex partners, especially those who do not always use condoms, and people in relationships with someone who is H.I.V.-positive. Young black men who have sex with other men are at highest risk. The drug would also be recommended for other high-risk people, like prostitutes.
The drug is meant not to replace condoms and other safe-sex measures, but to be used with them for added protection.
Experts say better methods of prevention are needed because there are 50,000 new H.I.V. infections a year in the United States. Several speakers emphasized Thursday that that number had not budged in 15 to 20 years. Counseling and condoms are not doing the job, they said, and many of the newly infected are men whose sexual partners do not realize they are H.I.V.-positive.
Many panelists voiced concern on Thursday about the possibility that people who become infected while taking Truvada could develop dangerous drug-resistant strains of the virus, but the panel decided that the benefits of preventing new infections outweighed the risks.
An F.D.A. analysis found that people who are older and more educated are more likely to take the drug faithfully. So are men who report having receptive anal sex without condoms. There is no data to tell whether Truvada would prevent H.I.V. infection spread by sharing needles.
Because Truvada has already been approved to treat H.I.V. infection, doctors are free to prescribe it for prevention, and some have been doing so. Prescribing a drug for something other than its approved purpose, called off-label use, is allowed by the F.D.A., though drug companies are not permitted to market or promote drugs for such uses.
Advocates of providing Truvada for prevention say F.D.A. approval would help ensure the drug was more safely and effectively used. The medicine would have to be labeled with specific instructions, including which lab tests patients needed to get for safety reasons. For instance, patients should be tested for H.I.V. infection before starting the drug, because if someone who is already infected takes Truvada alone, drug-resistant strains of the virus may quickly develop. Some patients may also need to have their kidney function checked. And the drug can also cause slight decreases in bone density that may need monitoring in some people.
Despite voting to recommend approval, the panelists struggled with questions about how to make sure that the needed tests are conducted. F.D.A. officials at the meeting argued strongly that there was no practical way for it to enforce a requirement for testing, and that in any case such a requirement would pose too much of a barrier to patients who wanted the preventive drugs.
The voting was not unanimous, and some members of the 22-member panel voted no or abstained because they thought there was not enough data to prove the drug safe and effective in women or black people.
F.D.A. approval may also make it more likely that insurers would cover preventive use, which costs about $14,000 a year.
Truvada, which contains two antiviral drugs, is sold by Gilead Sciences, based in Foster City, Calif. Though it is used alone for prevention, it must be taken along with other antivirals to treat H.I.V. First approved in 2004, it quickly became one of the best-selling H.I.V. drugs. Gilead reported Truvada sales of $758.3 million in the first quarter of this year, which would translate into more than $3 billion a year.
A Gilead official, Dr. Andrew Cheng, told the panel that if Truvada were approved for prevention, the company would conduct safety monitoring and provide educational materials to emphasize the importance of using other prevention methods as well, like condoms, counseling and regular H.I.V. testing. He said Gilead would also provide free condoms and testing for H.I.V. and hepatitis B; subsidized tests for viral resistance for people who become infected; and an assistance program for people with no prescription coverage.
Prevention studies of Truvada have been conducted in the past few years, with somewhat mixed results. A study of 2,499 gay men in six countries, published in 2010, found an overall risk reduction of 44 percent. When researchers looked more closely and checked blood levels of the drug, they found that many of the men had not taken the Truvada pill every day. Among those who did take it correctly, the risk reduction was about 90 percent. But only about 10 percent of the men took the pills exactly as directed.
Some studies in Africa and Asia have also shown significant risk reduction among healthy people whose partners were infected. But other studies in Africa were halted because the drug was showing no benefit in women; subsequent analyses revealed that many of the women were not taking the pills, sometimes because they did not think they were at risk.
The failure of some people in the studies to take the pills every day has led the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a medical and advocacy group based in Los Angeles, to contend that prescribing Truvada as prevention could backfire, leaving people vulnerable while lulling them into believing that sex without condoms is safe.
“You will definitely have a result that is far worse than what you had in any of the studies,” Michael Weinstein, the foundation’s president, said in an interview.
But a researcher who conducted the study in gay men, Dr. Robert M. Grant of the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, which is affiliated with the University of California, San Francisco, disagreed, comparing Mr. Weinstein’s argument to that of people in the 1970s who warned that air bags in cars would lead people to stop using seat belts.
“Did that happen?” Dr. Grant asked in an interview. “No.”
Matthew Rose, a membership coordinator for the National Lesbian & Gay Journalists Association, described himself to the panel as “a young, H.I.V.-negative black man.” He said he and many of his friends were excited about the prospect of a preventive drug.
Growing up gay in Washington, D.C., many young men have their sexual debut at 16 and are H.I.V.-positive by 25, he said, and facing that reality, many want another layer of protection.
“I ask you to give my community another option,” Mr. Rose told the panel. “We’re not saying it will end the epidemic. But give people options and choices that will work for them, things science tells us will give us a chance.”
