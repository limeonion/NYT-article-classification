Esther Wilkins, Who Set Standards for Dental Hygienists, Dies at 100 - The New York Times
Dr. Esther M. Wilkins, whose comprehensive textbook for the study of dental hygiene standardized how the field is taught worldwide, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Hudson, N.H. She was 100.
A niece, Betsy Tyrol, said the cause was a stroke that Dr. Wilkins had on the morning of her 100th birthday, three days earlier.
Until Dr. Wilkins laid out a modern curriculum for dental hygienists in 1959 in her textbook, “Clinical Practice of the Dental Hygienist,” there was no uniformity in what was taught.
In the 1950s, most hygienists worked in schools, teaching children how to prevent tooth decay. Only toward the end of the decade did some dentists started hiring them to remove patients’ plaque and tartar, among other duties.
“She set the standard for how everybody began to teach dental hygiene, and that was the tipping point,” said Ann Battrell, the chief executive of the American Dental Hygienists’ Association.
Dr. Wilkins graduated from Simmons College in Boston in 1938 with a degree in science, then earned a certificate at the nearby Forsyth School for Dental Hygienists the next year. Soon after that, she went to work for Dr. Frank Willis, a dentist in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Mass.
At a time when few women were dentists, she was accepted into the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, class of 1948. But a dean suggested that she defer a year so that she would not be the only female student. She agreed to wait.
Soon after she graduated, the University of Washington recruited her to start a dental hygiene program there, a major undertaking that entailed writing a curriculum and teaching most of the classes while searching to hire faculty.
Her lesson plans formed the basis of her seminal textbook, in which her ambition for hygienists was laid out: She urged them to think of themselves as prevention specialists who educated patients on, for example, how to avoid cavities and inflamed gums.
“I don’t think people appreciated dental hygienists until she came along and made sure they did,” said Dr. Tim Hempton, a periodontist at Tufts who shared an office with Dr. Wilkins for a decade.
In 1964, she returned to Tufts to study periodontology and reconnected with another former student, James B. Gallagher Jr., who was recently widowed. They married in 1966.
She taught at Tufts for 45 years, becoming an emeritus professor in 2011. She also traveled the world, giving more than 600 lectures in dozens of countries. At the podium she was formidable, scolding and sometimes funny.
Jane Weiner, one of the many hygienists she mentored, said Dr. Wilkins had liked to joke that bacteria were like children. “They start out in the pocket with Mommy and Daddy,” she quoted her as saying. “They go off to college or other parts of the mouth, and then they come home to roost.”
At annual conferences for hygienists, Dr. Wilkins would be mobbed by fans who wanted a snapshot with her.
“You’d see a line of people waiting to shake her hand and saying, ‘Please sign my book, Esther!’ ” said Dr. Huw F. Thomas, the dean of the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. “If only they treated deans of dental schools like that.”
In 2013, when Dr. Wilkins was 96 and in a wheelchair, four bodyguards were hired as her entourage. “You should have seen that woman,” said Ms. Battrell, of the hygienists association. “She was frail, but she was beaming because she had four big buff Boston cops surrounding her.”
Esther Mae Wilkins, the younger of two sisters, was born on Dec. 9, 1916, in Chelmsford, Mass., and grew up in nearby Tyngsboro. Her father, Ernest, was a handyman; her mother, the former Edith Packard, was a secretary. The family sold vegetables to supplement their income and at one time ran the local telephone switchboard in their house. A teenage Esther would rout calls.
Her husband died more than 20 years ago. No immediate family members survive.
Dr. Wilkins updated her textbook every four years or so. The 12th edition was published this year by Wolters Kluwer.
For the last decade of her life, Dr. Wilkins was hard of hearing, so Jonathan Joyce, the latest editor of her textbook, would fly to Boston when he needed to speak to her. Meticulous to a fault, he said, she was late handing in final revisions on her last edition, having labored over the text correcting even misplaced bullet points or commas.
“We pay people to copy-edit,” Mr. Joyce said he told her. “Your time is more valuable. Please, let it go.”
Dr. Wilkins hugged him as he was leaving, Mr. Joyce said, and replied, “I know you’re frustrated with me, but this is all I have.”
