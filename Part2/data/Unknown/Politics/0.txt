meet with three freed American prisoners after their arrival from North Korea at Joint Base Andrews on May 10 2018 in Joint Base Andrews Md  President Donald Trump is returning to the campaign trail with bigstage events targeting vulnerable Senate Democrats and mobilizing his most fervent supporters on behalf of Republicans after primaries this week that saw GOP congressmen lose in key races Trump plans to take the stage in Elkhart Indiana on Thursday night two days after Republicans nominated former state lawmaker Mike Braun to challenge vulnerable Democratic Sen Joe Donnelly Trumps political advisers view the event as a way to project party unity following a bruising primary Vice President Mike Pence the states former governor is expected to join Trump Trump was certain to hail the return of three Americans who had been held captive in North Korea Trump greeted the men during an overnight celebration and later announced plans to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore President Donald Trump announced Thursday that he will meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12 locking in a historic highstakes summit aimed at curbing the rogue nations nuclear weapons program Trump made the announcement via Twitter just hours after welcoming home three The Indiana rally comes as the president has told advisers he is eager to ramp up his campaign travel on behalf of Republicans The president who helped raise 132 million for the Republican National Committee in 2016 won 10 states where Democratic senators are on the ballot this year Hes expected to campaign heavily to help Republicans maintain Senate and House majorities and elect GOP governors The president takes his role as leader of the Republican Party very seriously and after more than a year in office he understands too few Democrats are willing to join hands across party lines to support issues that the American people resoundingly called for said White House political director Bill Stepien The presidents calendar is mapped out with his political priorities in mind Trumps bold strokes on the foreign stage come while he is dogged by the special counsels ongoing investigation into Russian election meddling and developments about his personal attorneys payments to a porn actress allowing him to frame the campaign debate specifically Donnellys no vote on last years tax overhaul Trumps political advisers chose to hold the rally in the heart of Donnellys political base Before his 2012 election the senator represented a House district that included Elkhart The city home to manufacturing jobs and the recreational vehicle industry was also paid a visit by President Barack Obama in 2009 when the region was suffering from unemployment rates surpassing 19 percent Obama returned to Elkhart in 2016 to point to economic progress but Trump carried the county and much of the region overwhelmingly that year The rally comes on the heels of bruising defeats this week for Republican incumbents Two Indiana congressmen making a bid for a US Senate seat lost to Braun a North Carolina congressman lost to a pastor and a third incumbent lost in a contested Senate primary in West Virginia Ahead of the rally Donnellys campaign said the senator had voted with Trump 62 percent of the time because he works for Hoosiers not any politician or political party The Indiana rally will be Trumps fourth politicalstyle event in the past two weeks Trump skipped the White House Correspondents Dinner late last month to rally supporters in Macomb County Michigan His speech last week to the National Rifle Association in Dallas put him before thousands of gunrights activists who actively backed his campaign And last Saturday Trump was in Ohio long the key electoral piece for any GOP presidential hopeful During the event in Cleveland Trump was joined by Rep Jim Renacci who won the Republican Senate nomination on Tuesday with the presidents endorsement Trump said Renaccis opponent Democratic US Sen Sherrod Brown does not think the way we think  when it comes to borders when it comes to so much delivering a message that Republicans hope to hear frequently If President Trump is willing to go out and define some of these opponents its extremely helpful to those campaigns said Barry Bennett a former Trump campaign aide Hell deliver the negative messages they can deliver the positive Ahead of West Virginias US Senate primary Trump tweeted that Republican candidate Don Blankenship couldnt win the November election against Democratic Sen Joe Manchin a top GOP target Advisers said the president was pleased that Republicans nominated Attorney General Pat Morrissey considered a stronger challenger against Manchin In West Virginia his one tweet singlehandedly swung the dynamics of a race Stepien said Stepien said Trump would engage in a similar way in future races if he feels particularly strongly about a race or feels a particular connection to a candidate but added that would happen less often A key to Trumps message will be energizing lowpropensity Republican voters in 2018 many of whom turned out for the first time in years to vote for him As he travels the country Trump will face the question of whether his appeal is transferable to downballot candidates much in the way that Obama struggled to rally core Democrats when he wasnt running himself Obama suffered broad losses in Congress and in statehouses during the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections an outcome Trump hopes to avoid Appearing at a Cabinet meeting Trump said that Tuesday ended up being a very big night for the Republican Party in primaries in West Virginia Ohio and elsewhere Every candidate that we wanted won and they did very well Trump said Wednesday There was tremendous enthusiasm
