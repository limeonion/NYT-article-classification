Republicans override Wisconsin Democratic senator to confirm federal judge for spot GOP blocked under Obama  Chicago Tribune Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks with reporters following a closeddoor strategy session on Capitol Hill on March 28 2017 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks with reporters following a closeddoor strategy session on Capitol Hill on March 28 2017 The political battle over President Donald Trumps judicial nominees escalated on Thursday when the Senate took the rare step of confirming the nomination of a Wisconsin attorney to serve as a federal judge despite the objections of one of his homestate senators The Senate voted along party lines to confirm Milwaukee attorney Michael Brennan to fill an opening on the 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals The tally was 4946 The seat has been open for more than eight years the longest for the nations appellate courts The Senate gives lawmakers a chance to weigh in on a judicial nominee from their home state by submitting a bluecolored form called the blue slip A positive blue slip signals the Senate to move forward with the nomination process A negative blue slip or withholding it altogether signals a senators objection and almost always stalls the nomination Until this year it had been nearly three decades since the Senate confirmed a judge without two positive blue slips Brennans confirmation marked the second time it has happened this year Sen Tammy Baldwin DWis declined to return her blue slip The move to go ahead with a hearing for Brennan and a vote on the floor had Democrats complaining that Republicans were eroding one of the few remaining customs in the Senate that forced consultation on judicial nominations They also noted that Republicans used the blue slip to block one of President Barack Obamas nominees for the very same judgeship Id admonish my friends on the other side of the aisle this is a very dangerous road youre treading said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer DNY As everyone knows the winds of political change blow swiftly in America The minority one day is the majority the next The warning was reminiscent of the one that Republican Sen Mitch McConnell issued when Democrats changed the rules to lower the threshold necessary to end a filibuster for district and circuit court judges Under the change the Senate can cut off debate with a simple majority rather than 60 votes At the time the Kentucky Republican said Youll regret this and you may regret this a lot sooner than you think Sen Chuck Grassley of Iowa the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Democrats complaints were based on an incorrect understanding of the blue slips history The blue slip courtesy is just that â€” a courtesy Grassley said He said past chairmen of the committee had rarely used negative or unreturned blue slips as unilateral vetoes The most recent exception was Democratic Sen Patrick Leahy of Vermont who was chairman during the first six years of Obamas presidency That was his prerogative Grassley said Still the blue slip has been in use for more than a century and only a handful of judges have won confirmation during that time without two blue slips Grassley said that under his tenure the blue slip will be used to ensure the president consults with homestate senators but not as a veto for appellate court nominees He said he was satisfied in Brennans case that the White House consulted with both of Wisconsins senators before the president nominated him Republicans have made it a priority to confirm the presidents nominees particularly those who will serve on federal appeals courts Its a top issue with social conservatives leading into this years midterm elections With Democrats slowwalking many of Trumps nominees McConnell said last October that the blue slip process should not be used to blackball nominees For Democrats it was particularly galling that Sen Ron Johnson RWis used his blue slip to object to Obama nominee Victoria Nourse to serve on the 7th Circuit She eventually withdrew from consideration Its mindbending hypocrisy Its an appalling double standard Schumer said Johnson said more than 1 million of the states residents had voted for him and he had no role whatsoever in the nomination of Nourse so I decided not to return the blue slip He said he does not believe the blue slip should be used as an absolute veto though The blue slip from my standpoint should primarily be used just as the advice and consent of one senator expressing an opinion on a judge from their state Johnson said Johnson noted that he did return a blue slip for a subsequent Obama nominee to the 7th Circuit Donald Schott However that nomination stalled because there was strong resistance from Republicans in going forward with any of Obamas nominees during his final year in office Just 11 federal judges won confirmation that year Republicans went ahead with a committee hearing and a vote for David Stras of Minnesota to serve as a circuit judge earlier this year despite one of his home state senators former Democratic Sen Al Franken declining to return his blue slip But Franken resigned about four weeks before the Stras confirmation vote The Senate has confirmed 35 of Trumps judicial nominees so far and Republicans are anxious to keep going I have pleaded with McConnell to work nights to work Saturdays and weekends and put the pressure on the Democrats And weve got to have every Republican around and even cancel a recess so we can clear the calendar of these important nominees Grassley said during an appearance on the Hugh Hewitt Show
