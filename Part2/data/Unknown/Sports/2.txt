Bulls QA Is No 6 too high to draft Mikal Bridges Whoaposs the GOAT MJ or LBJ  Chicago Tribune   Year 1 of the Bulls rebuild is in the books and for the purpose of judging each players 201718 season in that context — as well as their future with the team — weve given each a rating of horns up or horns down Kyle Korver is the last prominent former Bull standing in the playoffs And you have questions on a whole slew of topics Assuming the Bulls don’t strike draftlottery gold how strongly has the organization considered trading down from the 67 slot I like Mikal Bridges a lot for this roster but he would have better value getting drafted 10th instead of sixth Who says no if the Bulls offer the sixth pick to the 76ers for their two picks projected at No 10 and 27 — Nick Glen Ellyn If Bulls stay at No 6 or 7 and want to draft Bridges you at least have those conversations But if they don’t bear fruit I don’t think you can get hung up on value If Bridges is the fit he’s the fit I’ve alluded to agreeing that No 6 might seem high for Bridges given there are other players with socalled upside who could be there as well But particularly with the Bulls being in the second season of a rebuild and having three positions locked down I don’t think you can get too caught up in that You need to secure a longterm starter with this pick So if they think Bridges is it and they can’t find a trading partner below you where you’re confident Bridges will still be and you get an extra asset out of it you draft him regardless What’s your take on Jaren Jackson Jr from Michigan State I’d love to see him in a Bulls uniform — Steve Chicago The Bulls will have to move up in the lottery to make this a reality They know Jackson well not only from scouting him but also because his road roommate is Fred Hoiberg’s son Jack Like most young players there’s a ton of potential and risk If the Bulls did move up to No 3 I think they’d strongly consider him assuming Deandre Ayton and Marvin Bagley III are off the board Jackson has the tools to be a strong twoway player and his rim protection would fit well alongside Lauri Markkanen I personally would get a kick out of covering him since his dad coached me when I — LOL — tried out for the D League now G League nearing age 40 Read it and weep What do you think about the LeBron vs MJ debate — Scott Bolingbrook Comparing players from different eras might be fun for debate but it’s ultimately fruitless And at least to me it threatens to take some of the sheen off the greatness we’re all witnessing Why can’t that be enough I know I often took moments while covering the second threepeat to take a step back and remind myself that I was fortunate enough to be witnessing greatness — and history I do the same now with James albeit while seeing him play less frequently in person Behold them both Hypothetical time If Derrick Rose never got hurt who has a better career him or Russell Westbrook — Justin R Boca Raton Fla Because we’re playing the hypothetical game I’d say there’s a good chance the Bulls would’ve been in the 2012 NBA Finals if Rose never went down So they would’ve been guarding each other I’m comfortable guessing that Rose never would’ve averaged a tripledouble in a season They each own an MVP award Westbrook is a slightly better 3point shooter although neither is good from that distance It’s a fun debate I think their careers would’ve played out similarly with multiple AllStar Games and MVP considerations although Westbrook’s individual statistics would’ve been a bit gaudier It has been reported that the Bulls are likely to bring Zach LaVine back no matter what Would they really match an exorbitant offer just because he was once the key piece in the Jimmy Butler deal — A Onatende Chicago It’s less because he was once the key piece in the Jimmy Butler deal and more because he’s the projected starting shooting guard for the next decade That said if he signed a max offer sheet with another team I’d be just as intrigued as you to see whether the Bulls match it They have to pay Kris Dunn and Lauri Markkanen eventually and it feels they’re still one impact player away from championship contention even with all three players signed Luckily for the Bulls very few teams will possess the salarycap space to sign LaVine to a max offer sheet Also the days of 2016 “funny money free agency appear to be fading As I’ve said all along I expect the LaVine negotiations to hit some bumps as most negotiations do But I also know both sides are motivated to get a deal done so I think that happens And I predict it’s less than the max Do you expect a playoff push next season I think the Bulls will be too good to tank to the top of the lottery without blatantly resting players But I also can’t see which of top eight teams in the East the Bulls are capable of passing next year Maybe the Cavaliers if LeBron James leaves in free agency I fear we will miss the playoffs and draft 14th— again — Dan M Northbrook Implied in your last sentence is dissatisfaction with Denzel Valentine — but maybe it’s just me Executive vice president John Paxson already addressed this dynamic at his seasonending news conference The Bulls aren’t angling for the highest possible draft pick again next year Doing that once was distasteful enough for him and the franchise That said I agree it might be hardpressed to put together a playoff season This is why this year’s draft and either 2018 or 2019 free agency are so big Those are the best chances to add another impact player The Bulls project to be a lottery team next season but not a high one What is the Bulls’ scoutingdrafting process like The Bears seemed to have the coaches very involved If the Bulls are building a systematic culture through Hoiberg he should also have some say Teams such as the Spurs and Celtics seem to succeed because they have a system against which they can evaluate players their skills and mentality Do you think this is the Bulls’ direction — Bauer Poison Mont Well they finally assembled a roster that fits how Hoiberg wants to play offensively in Year 3 of his tenure Next season projects to feature more of the same The Bulls include their coach in the drafting process But even Hoiberg said his input should be only a piece of the puzzle because management and the scouting staff are the ones working on the process all season while he coaches Thanks for all your questions Talk soon — KC Timberwolves assistant coach Rick Brunson resigns amid accusations of improper conduct toward women » Commentary Is LeBron James
