Toronto is now the saddest sports city Unless itaposs Cincinnati Or maybe itaposs still Washington  Chicago Tribune Before this month it had been 20 years since one of Washingtons four major professional sports teams appeared in a conference final It has been just as long since one of those teams appeared in a championship series when the Caps lost the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals to Detroit in four games If you really believe Washingtons sports curse is over  beaten black and blue by Braden Holtbys waffle pad vanquished by Evgeny Kuznetsovs backhand into the fivehole of history  there are other sports cities and states left to cry for For these cities which have at least two major professional sports teams the wait for a championshipround appearance has been at least 15 years And their wait continued even after the Caps finished off Pittsburgh in six games Monday night Cincinnati Last title appearance 1990 World Series Result Reds defeat Athletics in four games Jose Rijo threw a twohitter in 8 13 innings Hal Morris smacked a deep flyball to right field to score a man in the eight inning to put the Reds in front for good in Game 4 and Cincinnati swept Oakland to clinch the title Before that the Bengals reached the Super Bowl after the 1988 season but lost to San Francisco 2016 when Joe Montana hit John Taylor in the end zone from 10 yards out Since both teams have been models of consistency in their own ways The Reds have been to the postseason just four times since 1990 The Bengals have been to the playoffs seven of the past 13 seasons under Coach Marvin Lewis but never advanced beyond the first round Toronto Last title appearance 1993 World Series Results Blue Jays defeat Phillies in six games It has been all downhill for Toronto since Joe Carter smacked a walkoff home run in Game 6 of the 1993 series against Philadelphia the Blue Jays second consecutive World Series title The Maple Leafs advanced to the conference finals earlier that year but lost to the Los Angeles Kings The Raptors were still two years from playing their first season as an expansion team It was a great time to be a Toronto fan And then the Jays went 21 years without a playoff appearance The Leafs couldnt reach the Stanley Cup Finals even with four teams that earned 100 points in that span The Raptors have emerged as contenders in the NBAs Eastern Conference in recent years but keep running into a playoff buzz saw named LeBron James Minnesota Last title appearance 1991 World Series Result Twins defeat Braves in seven games In Game 7 Jack Morris refused to leave the mound after nine innings of shutout work for the Twins and he threw a perfect 10th inning too Gene Larkin singled in Dan Gladden from third base with one out in the bottom of the 10th to win it ESPN labeled that World Series the best yet in its centennial celebration of baseballs championship round And then like the Blue Jays the Twins fell into a postseason drought this one lasting 10 years The Timberwolves had something special between 1996 and 2004 with Kevin Garnett in his prime they made eight straight playoff appearances capped off with a trip to the 2004 Western Conference finals but met Kobe Bryant and Shaquille ONeal ending that postseason run The Wild didnt take the ice until 2000 yet somehow managed a trip to the conference finals in 2003 That ended in a sweep against Anaheim And the Vikings have lost four NFC title games in the last 20 years Buffalo Last title appearance 1999 Stanley Cup Finals Result Sabres lose to Stars in seven games No one could break a 11 tie through two overtimes in Game 7 between the Sabres and Dallas Stars Then with 510 to play in the third extra period Brett Hull poked a rebound past a sprawling Dominik Hasek to win the Stanley Cup for Dallas Buffalo was able to string together some good years after the colossal disappointment and made consecutive conference finals in 2006 and 2007 But the team has missed the playoffs in each of the past seven seasons Meanwhile in the 1994 Super Bowl the Bills got out to a 136 lead at half before Dallas pounded the ball with future Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith until the Buffalo defense broke Smith finished with two touchdowns and 132 yards on 20 carries It was the fourth Super Bowl in a row for the Bills and the fourth straight loss Buffalo made four more playoff appearances over the next six years but never with the same mojo In 2000 it missed the playoffs altogether with an 88 record In 2001 it was out of the postseason picture with a 313 mark That was part of a 17year postseason drought So these four regions could now use your thoughts prayers and a little puck luck And really Washington DC could too because the citys 20year streak without a championship appearance hasnt yet ended Those upstart 200708 Rock the Red Capitals were a blast to watch and then were undone by Joffrey Lupuls backhand on the power play in Game 7 against Philadelphia The next year it was the Penguins then the Canadiens then the Lightning then the Rangers two years in a row Skip a season and it was the Rangers one more time in 2015 then the Penguins in 2016 and 2017 Thats a lot of heartbreak The Wizards havent made it past the second round the Redskins have lost their last four playoff games and the Nationals have never won a playoff series If you think reaching the NHLs Eastern Conference finals is enough to lift Washingtons curse you now have four sports markets to choose from that could use your sympathy
