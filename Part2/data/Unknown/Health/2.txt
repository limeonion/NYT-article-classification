aposThirdhand smokeapos may be dangerous months after cigarette smoke has dissipated  Chicago Tribune First came doctors warnings about cigarettes Then came discoveries about the danger of secondhand smoke Now a growing number of scientists are raising the alarm about thirdhand smoke  residual chemicals left on indoor surfaces by tobacco smoke Mounting research has shown such potentially hazardous residue can be absorbed through the skin ingested and inhaled months and even years after the smoke has dissipated One study this year showed thirdhand smoke increased risk of lung cancer in mice Another study last year showed liver damage and diabetes in mice A third study this year focused on casinos and showed that six months after smoking was banned heavy smoke residue remained on the walls and carpet The latest study published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances shows how tobacco smoke from outdoor air can seep into a nonsmoking classroom and coat its surfaces and how those hazardous chemicals often become airborne again and circulate throughout buildings via central air conditioning systems It shows that just because youre in a nonsmoking environment it doesnt mean you arent exposed to tobacco said Peter DeCarlo an atmospheric chemist at Drexel University in Philadelphia and lead author of the study That Uber car you jump into the hotel room you stay in even a classroom where smoking hasnt been allowed for decades These are places where you are often exposed to a lot more than you expect The latest findings were in some ways an accident DeCarlo who studies outdoor air had teamed up with an indoor air expert at Drexel Michael Waring to study how the two interact A graduate student working with them was surveying chemicals in a classroom about 20 feet from DeCarlos office and came across a mysterious chemical signature they couldnt explain At first they suspected residue from coffee which is ubiquitous in universities But after a battery of tests they were surprised to find signs pointing to nicotine and tobacco smoke residue To replicate the chemical signature they ran a series of experiments blowing cigarette smoke into a glass Pyrex jar clearing out the smoke and letting the jar sit for a week The residue was an exact match they found So they turned their investigative efforts toward the classroom running a series of tests in which they pumped outdoor air in and out of the room They found that tobacco smoke can enter indoor spaces and cling to surfaces Then especially in summer when rooms get blasted by air conditioning the chemicals not only become airborne again but can spread readily through the ventilation system of buildings This adds a twist to what we are just starting to discover about thirdhand smoke said Hugo Destaillats a chemist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California who has conducted similar research but was not involved in the Drexel study It shows how much we still have to learn about the mechanics of this kind of exposure Public health experts have accumulated mountains of data on how lethal smoking is And they have vast data on the harms of secondhand smoke But the idea of thirdhand smoke only began to emerge in the past decade Research so far on its health effects suggests it could be harmful but data remains scarce and mostly limited to studies involving mice What researchers are certain of however is that the chemicals from tobacco smoke often linger on clothes surfaces and even skin Public health advocates worry that those most vulnerable to the harmful effects of thirdhand smoke are also those who most likely to come into contact with it A baby crawling on the ground for example has much more contact with carpets where cigarette residue often resides And because of increasing socioeconomic disparities in smoking lowincome families are more likely to live in homes and neighborhoods where decades of smoking have led to thirdhand smoke accumulation I dont think we have a clue how big the problem is said Matthew L Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids Its impossible from the science so far to say how widespread and serious the risk is but what weve seen already only adds to the reasons smoking should be banned in public places Growing research on such residue has prompted legislatures to consider laws banning smoking on premises like childcare centers even afterhours when no children are present The American Academy of Pediatricians has issued recommendations to limit childrens exposure to thirdhand smoke And in recent years California has created a new consortium of scientists funded by the states cigarette taxes to research the mechanics and possible dangers of thirdhand smokeÂ  William Wan is a
