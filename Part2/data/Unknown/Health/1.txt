Dating after cancer means showing up with aposFillapos the bag that collects my waste  Chicago Tribune Allison Rosen in the hospital wearing a Christmas hat in an undated photograph  Allison Rosen in the hospital wearing a Christmas hat in an undated photograph  In our era of swipeleft swiperight dating theres no perfect time to reveal your personal baggage Im talking about revealing longburied secrets like the failed marriage to your high school sweetheart or the mindbending ex who messed up your view on relationships My baggage I show up to every date with the other man in my life One who for years I struggled to live with but who ultimately I just cant live without Someone who is close to my heart but closer to other parts of my body His name is Fill Fill is my ileostomy bag a permanent bag attached to my abdomen collecting waste Its tricky enough to tell a prospective boyfriend you had cancer Its another thing entirely to explain that after battling colorectal cancer you live with a permanent ileostomy bag Hows that for a cantresist dating profile post Yet after multiple surgeries therapy sessions and support groups I proclaim myself a survivor I cant distract from my bag like other types of personal baggage Sure there are ways to hide it At first I wore a special wrap to help conceal it I realize now that no one notices its even there even under a little black dress unless I tell them Still its always right there right up against my skin Its physical Its permanent And for some people I suppose its gross I get it You just dont see bowel movements up there with a hair toss and a comehither whisper But as many couples eventually realize awkward milestones like passing gas in front of one another are oddly relieving pun fully intended It implies a relationship has reached a state of shared intimacy and mutual comfort But to deal with that on a second date Not always fun or easy And yet its what I have chosen to do because if you want me you get Fill Were a package deal Humor helps Thats why some friends encouraged me years ago to give my bag a name At first it was difficult to tell my dates about it I felt embarrassed and insecure However I have been pleasantly surprised how accepting some of them have been One guy jokingly made noises of his own when Fill started making his characteristic gurgling noises Before cancer when it came to love I had already come to the realization that serial dating was a waste of time that I wanted to find a serious relationship and settle down Almost at the same time as I had this epiphany I got a phone call from my doctor after my annual colonoscopy as a longtime Crohns Disease patient this was part of my routine care Only this time the doctor asked if I could come to her office to discuss the results in person She had never done that before Allison Rosenon a First Descents trip in this undated photograph  Allison Rosenon a First Descents trip in this undated photograph  When I got to her office across the street from my lab my eyes were already filled with tears She gently but straightforwardly told me the bad news and I panicked seeing my life flash before my eyes At 32 years old I had colorectal cancer For the next five years I kept a razorsharp focus on simply surviving Dating Forget about it Of course I got lonely I thought back to the few dates Id had with a promising guy right before my diagnosis I told him about my diagnosis via text and got an abrupt Well good luck with life farewell along with a cancellation of our upcoming date The words devastated me They made me think that no one would ever love me after cancer After my first major surgery I had a temporary ileostomy Fill though he wasnt yet named was supposed to be a fling not a mate for life The bag was uncomfortable in every way It took me months to find one that didnt irritate my already sensitive skin Many nights I cried thinking I would never learn how to live with this new part of me My team of nurses at MD Anderson Cancer Center finally helped me find a bag that worked and with my moms help I got to the point I could put the bag on myself A small but significant victory I was so relieved when I traded my bag in for an internal Jpouch which is a surgically created pouch that would now act as my removed colon With the bag gone I didnt look terribly sick to the outside world but I felt lousy and had other changes related to treatment To my surprise my body image challenges were still there which I later learned is quite a common problem for cancer survivors I saw myself go from a fit woman who more or less liked her body before cancer to one who didnt recognize herself anymore I lost a lot of weight I couldnt fit into any of my clothes My hair was falling out Not anyones idea of a dream date I was physically cancerfree my bag was gone but I was still saddled with insecurity Nonetheless after watching friend after friend get married I found the confidence to dive into dating again My first date after I was declared cancerfree was exactly what I needed at the time Following a few enjoyable movie and dinner outings I began acting awkward I was struggling to find the right way to tell him about my cancer When I finally and tearfully confessed my past I was relieved at his acceptance At that moment I realized that everyone has baggage Mine just might be a little bit different Not long after this realization intense stomach pains brought me to the ER where my internal pouch was accidentally punctured during a colonoscopy causing a lifethreatening abdominal abscess After this I immediately returned to MD Anderson and my trusted colorectal surgeon It was decided I needed emergency surgery including creation of yet another ileostomy My external bag was back but I was alive And my dating life was once again on hold It wasnt until I went on a surfing adventure trip with a nonprofit group called First Descents that I was surrounded by other inspiring and amazing survivors who like myself had physical and emotional scars Though my longtime friends were incredibly supportive as I was fighting the disease this trip was the first time that I finally spent extended time with young people who understood exactly what I had gone through They gave me the confidence to wear a bikini and to go surfing with the top of my bag showing my scars on full display The trip was lifechanging in so many ways It was there among my cancer peers that a new friend suggested the Fill nickname for my bag It has stuck this day It is crazy to think  after just one week these people who started as strangers could help me become more secure with my body image and bag Allison Rosens cancer research lab coworkers visited her in the hospital in this undated photograph Allison Rosens cancer research lab coworkers visited her in the hospital in this undated photograph This trip and my interactions with other cancer survivors gave me the strength to put myself back out there and date again Despite my ileostomy Despite my scars Despite my bag Now when I date if I like a guy I tell him about Fill I now work for the Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine where I get to tell my story and encourage others not to wait to see a doctor if they feel something might be wrong I am also on the Young Adult Advisory Council at MD Anderson and help plan the Centers Cancer Survivorship Conference I have even participated in their annual bodypositivity fashion show to demonstrate to others that you can be fashionable and confident even with an ileostomy bag attached to your body Working with the public to help prevent cancer or helping those recently diagnosed especially young adults is like living a dream Ive come to realize my views on appearance have evolved Prior to my cancer I would look at a guy online and be attracted solely based on outward appearance I also wasnt spared from my own critical gaze While generally happy with my appearance I used to pick apart my hourglass shape Now I think my curves are beautiful I want my future partner to think so too as well as love the other lessthanbeautiful baggage I carry I need someone who will be supportive someone who would be there for me if I ever get sick again I know there are good guys out there who will accept me for who I am That now includes the bag and ileostomy which was made permanent in December 2016 I never expected to still be single at 37 I didnt have a choice in developing colon cancer but I did have a choice in how I decided to manage complicated and painful treatments as well as the countless side effects which followed Despite the cliché I believe everything happens for a reason and cancer certainly changed my definition of love Love is being vulnerable and unconditionally honest to yourself and the partner who complements your life And thats baggage I am proud to carry She was told her perpetually runny nose was from
