speaks about the hardship that proposed work requirements for SNAP recipients would cause his family if they go into effect at the Common Pantry in Chicago on Wednesday April 18 2018 Stacey Wescott  Chicago Tribune A plan to dramatically expand work requirements for recipients of food stamp benefits could put more than 500000 adults in Illinois at risk of losing aid if they aren’t employed at least parttime or participating in job training Advocates for the poor say the changes could deepen poverty throughout the country by taking food assistance from those who sorely need it They argue that the vast majority of food stamp recipients are children disabled or elderly and say many of those who are able to work already do But as the economy continues to bounce back from the Great Recession the Trump administration and some Republicans in Congress are pushing more aggressive policies to get people off  various forms of public assistance and into jobs The food stamp program already requires many recipients to work at least 20 hours a week though states can apply for waivers for higher unemployment areas But a proposal in the  farm bill which could be voted on as early as next week in the US House of Representatives would strengthen that requirement by mandating that recipients work until the age of 59 instead of 49 More parents also would  be required to work “That would send me back to the streets said Vernice Taggett 47 of having to comply with work requirements to receive food stamp benefits Taggett has been trying to turn her life around since her release from prison last summer after serving three years for selling drugs The North Lawndale native completed a skills training program and now works 30 hours a week in a transitional job able to get by on her 10anhour wage with the help of food stamp benefits and Medicaid With her criminal record Taggett is unsure how eager employers will be to hire her once she completes the 90day job at Sweet Beginnings a social enterprise that makes honey body lotions and other products Taggett’s story reflects the concern of antihunger advocates who say some ablebodied recipients might not be able to satisfy the requirement because of persistent barriers to employment such as having a criminal record But with more investment in job training many of those people could reenter the workforce said Rep Rodney Davis a Republican from central Illinois who served on the House Agriculture Committee that crafted the proposal “Why would anyone be opposed to investing in employment and training to get people into jobs  I think it’s a travesty Our goal should not be to have people on public assistance in perpetuity Davis said The proposed farm bill in the House would cut more than 9 billion in benefits from the food stamp program formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program over a 10year period The House bill also would increase administrative spending for statelevel job and training programs by more than 7 billion according to Congressional Budget Office estimates Lawmakers in the US Senate are working on their own version of the farm bill More than 42 million Americans — including 17 million in Illinois — receive food stamp benefits despite the low national unemployment rate of 39 percent The average monthly benefit per person is roughly 130 The push to strengthen work requirements for those receiving public assistance stretches beyond the food stamp program President Donald Trump signed an executive order in midApril giving all Cabinet departments 90 days to produce plans that impose work requirements on ablebodied aid recipients Shortly after the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed a bill that would make it easier for public housing agencies to set minimum work requirements The Chicago Housing Authority is one of a handful of housing agencies across the country that already has work requirements for ablebodied beneficiaries In January the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services invited states to request permission to make work a condition of Medicaid eligibility At least 11 states have filed waiver requests and four have been approved Illinois Gov Bruce Rauner at the time said he supports work requirements for Medicaid but it wouldn’t be a policy priority until the state generates more jobs The Rauner administration supports the farm bill’s increased funding for job training “We are encouraged by the bill’s commitment to training and education services for SNAP recipients because we believe that gaining meaningful employment is the best path to building better futures for their families said Meghan Powers spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Human Services in a statement No one seems to argue that people shouldn’t work if they can but advocates who assist the poor worry about unintended consequences of work requirements Criminal records lack of transportation illiteracy and undiagnosed mental health conditions make it difficult for many people to find and keep jobs advocates say Inconsistent and unpredictable schedules could keep parttime workers from logging enough hours to comply with the requirements In other words just because people are physically able to work doesn’t mean they can find a job that will lift them out of poverty The North Lawndale Employment Network provides job training and transitional work for more than 2500 people annually more than 60 percent of whom have criminal records Many of the organization’s clients — even those who have high school diplomas — test at a sixth or seventhgrade academic level far below what’s required for most jobs said Brenda Palms Barber the nonprofit’s executive director “It disappoints me that people want to kick them while they’re down Palms Barber said of the proposed work requirements One group that could be affected by tightened work requirements is the LGBTQ community which has a higher unemployment rate than the general population in part because of the discrimination and harassment gay and transgender people encounter at work said Darnell Motley a senior researcher at the University of Chicago’s Center of Interdisciplinary Intervention which recently launched a career services initiative tailored to LGBTQ youth Motley worries that denying public assistance to LGBTQ youth who struggle to find work or even jobtraining programs — a problem in rural areas — could have public health consequences as they might feel pushed to earn money through prositution raising their risk of HIV infection he said At Heartland Alliance Health many of the people who seek help applying for public food and health aid as well as Social Security benefits are homeless and unable to work because of physical or mental health issues but lack official disability documentation said Dylan Prendergast senior benefits and entitlements specialist While it is not necessary to be approved for Social Security Disability Insurance — a process that can take years — to be exempt from work requirements many people don’t even have a primary care doctor to complete the forms and provide the medical evidence  required for the work exemption he said Alexander Jones 49 relied on SNAP and Medicaid during intermittent periods of homelessness and says he didn’t have a primary care doctor at the time who might have signed off on a work exemption A bad back and arthritis in his knees and calves make it difficult for him to do the kind of physical work that he is qualified for he said “It’s not that I don’t want to work I just don’t think I’m capable of working an eighthour job said Jones who now lives with his sister in Chicago’s Uptown neighborhood He tried applying for Social Security Disability Insurance on and off for 10 years until he was approved in 2016 with help from Heartland Alliance He now receives 730 a month Still he would prefer to earn a paycheck “It gives you a sense of worth it makes you want to do better Jones said The federal food stamp program already has some work requirements People from 18 to 49 years old who have no children or disabilities are required to work 20 hours a week Or they can participate in certain stateapproved job training education and volunteer programs Failing to do any of that triggers a time limit They only can receive benefits for three months within three years Most SNAP recipients in Illinois haven’t had to worry too much about that time limit For the past 20 years Illinois has requested and been granted statewide or partial waivers from that requirement Illinois is not alone Thirtysix states and territories currently have either statewide or partial waivers for areas with higher unemployment The House farm bill would require food stamp recipients to work until the age of 59 not 49 beginning in 2021 Parents of children ages 6 and older also would have to work As a result more than 500000 people in Illinois would potentially have to satisfy that 20houraweek requirement to consistently receive food stamp benefits according to estimates from both left and rightleaning think tanks Some say that’s a positive step “Anything that can be done to move more and more ablebodied adults back into work is a good thing said Jonathan Ingram vice president of research for Foundation for Government Accountability a rightleaning think tank based in Florida But there could also be fallout as DuPage County is learning Illinois did not include jobsrich DuPage in its request for a waiver from existing work requirements this year As a result more than 1700 ablebodied food stamp recipients in DuPage lost their benefits earlier this month according to the DuPage Federation on Human Services a nonprofit that partners with state agencies and other groups to help people in need In the months leading up to the lift of the waiver in DuPage nonprofits and human services caseworkers  sought to connect people to jobs and as needed connect people to physical and mental health diagnoses for exemptions said Candace King executive director of the DuPage Federation on Human Services Despite those efforts King said those who lost their benefits likely included some who couldn’t be reached or had undiagnosed conditions “There are people who fall between the cracks King said What remains unclear is the impact the proposed changes would have on the ability of states to request waivers for areas with higher unemployment rates The leftleaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that the  waived areas currently include about 36 percent of the nationwide population but that would be more than cut in half to about 17 percent On the whole the negative impact of the proposed work requirements far outweigh the benefits of additional job training investment according to the center’s analysis The bill would allocate 1 billion a year to be divvied up among the states for employment and training but that only amounts to about 30 per ablebodied beneficiary according to the center which opposes the proposed changes to the food assistance program  By 2028 12 million fewer people would receive SNAP benefits in an average month as a result of the stricter work rules a 37 percent reduction in total caseload according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office Other changes to the food aid program in the farm bill would cause another 400000 households to lose eligibility in an average year and 265000 children to lose access to free school meals according to the estimates There’s criticism of the bill on the right too though for very different reasons The Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank doesn’t think the bill goes far enough in expanding the work requirements in higher unemployment areas because states will still be able to apply waivers and other exemptions said Robert Rector senior research fellow Yet the bill is overly punitive in other respects — not fulfilling the work requirement can cost a person their benefits for a full year for the first transgression Rector said Illinois is  already doing some work to nudge people into the workforce Last year more than 11400 households transitioned out of the food stamp program because of increased earnings an increase of 32 percent from the previous year said Powers the Department of Human Services spokeswoman Those transitions were possible because of the recovering economy and the state’s efforts she said But Illinois’ flawed  computer system that launched last year — inadvertently bumping tens of thousands of SNAP recipients off their benefits just before Christmas — has continued to be a headache for caseworkers already overwhelmed by growing workload said Anne Irving public policy director for the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees the union representing most DHS caseworkers in Illinois Expanding work requirements across the state would be a “recipe for disaster she said In Illinois food banks worry about meeting the increased demand associated with any widespread loss of food stamp benefits More than 40 human service organizations in Illinois — including groups like United Way of Illinois Greater Chicago Food Depository and Chicago Jobs Council — have banded together to fight the proposed expansion of work requirements “If these cuts go through we’ll never be able to make up the difference said Kate Maehr executive director of the Greater Chicago Food Depository The work requirements are not a sure thing As House Republicans work to galvanize enough support among their ranks to pass the bills senators in both parties have vowed to produce a more bipartisan farm bill At the Common Pantry in the North Center neighborhood on a recent afternoon dozens of people across race gender and age lined up for their allotment of groceries Their stories illustrated the complexities that often accompany poverty Felipe Cruz 65 said he receives about 300 a month in food stamp benefits for himself and his 43yearold son Phillip who suffers from various health conditions “Even if I wanted to work I couldn’t because I have to take care of my son Cruz said Nancy Guigle a longtime volunteer at the pantry is still spry enough at age 78 to scale a stepladder to grab canned goods Guigle said she’s seen varying levels of need over the years among people who walk through the doors Likewise she worries about people abusing the food stamp program “Some have very legit reasons to be here Others are opportunists Guigle said “But if they have the oomph to say ‘We have the need’ we cannot say ‘No you don’t’ gtrotterchicagotribunecom aelejalderuizchicagotribunecom Twitter GregTrotterTrib Twitter
