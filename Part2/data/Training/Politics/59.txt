• Mollie Hemingway in The Federalist:
“Anyone is welcome to believe that this firing was unwise, and to make the case for that, but it’s wise to make that case calmly.”
Mollie Hemingway believes that President Trump was right to fire James B. Comey and lists the reasons the F.B.I. director had to go. She also addresses critics of the president who have described his action as a “coup,” writing, “Trump fired someone who worked for him. He fired someone in whom people in both major political parties had lost confidence.” Read more »

• Charles C. W. Cooke in National Review:
“I’m not going to credit theories about Watergate-level conspiracies without evidence, and my friend is. That’s the line that divides us.”
We found this short note by Charles Cooke illuminating. Writing for the National Review blog, Mr. Cooke explains what he calls the “Comey divide.” It is the animating division between those who believe there is a “huge Russia scandal” and those who don’t. The former are right to respond with “hysteria.” The latter are justified in their subdued skepticism. Read more »

• John Podhoretz in Commentary:
“Barack Obama should have fired him right then and there.”
John Podhoretz believes that Mr. Comey deserved to be fired, not by President Trump but by President Barack Obama. [Note: Commentary allows you to read one free article a month.] Read more »

• Philip Giraldi in American Conservative:
“The simplest explanation for the firing of Comey is the most likely: Donald Trump doesn’t like him much and doesn’t trust him at all.”
Philip Giraldi, a former C.I.A. officer, is skeptical about any nefarious reasons for Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey. He reminds his readers of the chain of command: “While it is convenient to believe that the F.B.I. director operates independently from the politicians who run the country, the reality is that he or she works for the attorney general, who in turn works for the president.” Read more »

• David Frum in The Atlantic:
“Now comes the hour of testing. Will the American system resist? Or will it be suborned?”
The loudest alarm bell on the right comes from David Frum, whose article last night carried the headline “This Is Not A Drill.” Mr. Frum calls upon Republicans in Congress to stand up to what he sees as an attack on the integrity of American institutions. Read more »

• John Nichols in The Nation:
“Sessions should step down. Immediately.”
John Nichols reminds his readers that Attorney General Jeff Sessions promised to recuse himself from all matters related to an investigation into Russia. Mr. Sessions’s involvement in Mr. Comey’s dismissal is intolerable to Mr. Nichols and grounds for removal. If Mr. Sessons refuses to resign, Mr. Nichols calls upon House Democrats and Republicans to move for his impeachment. Read more »

• Yascha Mounk in Slate:
“If you cross Trump’s interests by doing your job, you may well get fired. And that’s the best-case scenario.”
Yascha Mounk views this as a “moment of truth” for Republicans. He singles out figures like Senators John McCain and Ben Sasse to rescue the “independence of the F.B.I.” and restore what he says are eroding checks and balances on the president’s power. Read more »

• Roger Parloff in New York Magazine:
“The triptych charade employed to fire Comey — the Rosenstein to Sessions to Trump sleight-of-hand — is one of those grand and audacious lies that just leaves you shaking your head.”
Roger Parloff takes issue with the memo written by Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending Mr. Comey’s dismissal. The content of the memo would have been more convincing, Mr. Parloff argues, had it been delivered last July or August, not months after President Trump’s praise for the very deeds that led to Mr. Comey’s firing.

• Alex Shephard in New Republic:
“If Republicans don’t step up now, then they never will.”
Alex Shephard sees this moment as a test for Republicans who have been muted in their criticism of the Trump administration. So far, he notes, G.O.P. leaders have either remarked on the poor timing of the decision, as it relates to getting health care passed, or offered weak condemnations unequal to the threat this action poses to American democracy.

• Mattathias Schwartz in The Intercept:
“What’s most notable about the Rosenstein memo is what it does not say.”
Mattathias Schwartz is unsatisfied with the administration’s reasoning for Mr. Comey’s firing. He notes that Mr. Rosenstein does not explicitly recommend that Mr. Trump fire his F.B.I. director, and never mentions any “necessary corrective actions” that Mr. Comey could have taken to save his job. A better explanation, Mr. Schwartz writes, must come from the president himself. Read more »

• Benjamin Wittes and Susan Hennessey in Lawfare:
“Getting rid of Comey removes the guy who is running the Russia investigation. It removes [...] the essential person for a credible investigation.”
Benjamin Wittes and Susan Hennessey describe Mr. Comey’s firing as a “profoundly dangerous” thing. It threatens the integrity of law enforcement and undermines the credibility of the very presidency. They note that they have not called for a special prosecutor to this point, trusting that Mr. Rosenstein was a man of integrity. After his involvement in this “tawdry episode,” however, they recommend that he stand aside. Mr. Wittes and Ms. Hennessey conclude this careful but sharply worded explanation of the “nightmare scenario,” fearful for what comes next for the FBI. Read more »

• Politico Magazine:
“Is this a constitutional crisis? If not, what is it, and how dangerous?”
Democratic leaders such as Keith Ellison, a representative from Minnesota and the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, reacted to the news by declaring that we are in the midst of a “constitutional crisis.” The calls led editors of Politico Magazine to assemble a team of legal scholars to explain just what is meant by the term and if it applies to our current political moment.
