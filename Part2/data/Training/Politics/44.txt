Mollie Hemingway in The Federalist:
Ms. Hemingway acknowledges that “everything went Democrats’ way” in the Virginia election. It was a tidal wave that had a number of causes she points to in her piece, including the weakness of the Republican candidate Ed Gillespie, and the carefully crafted statewide campaign from the Democratic National Committee. She also warns against pundits who claim that this race is predictive of the 2018 midterms. She admits, however, that for Republicans to hold on to their House majority, they are going to “have to make the case for their survival” with legislative wins. Read more »

Joel B. Pollak in Breitbart:
Over at Breitbart, Mr. Pollak argues that the Virginia election for governor is not so much a repudiation of the president but, rather, a rejection of the establishment. Moreover, he sees the results as a reflection of voters’ concerns over health care, writing that Virginia voters “continue to prefer the insurance they do not have to the insurance Republicans will give them.” And while he places most of the blame on the Republican leaders Mitch McConnell and Paul D. Ryan, he concedes that when it comes to legislative accomplishment, “the buck stops with Trump.” Read more »

Jim Geraghty in National Review: 
According to Mr. Geraghty, those on the right who blame Mr. Gillespie’s establishment ties and those on the left who emphasize his Trump-inspired campaign strategy are both right. In a sense, he writes, “Gillespie’s getting the worst of both worlds.” And however you choose to explain his loss — and the Republican Party’s statewide losses in Virginia and elsewhere — “Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration should feel slapped in the face.” Read more »

Joan Walsh in The Nation:
Ms. Walsh suggests that we understand Ralph S. Northam’s victory as a result of the energy introduced by female and other diverse candidates running for positions in the statehouse. And while she admits that this “reverse-coattails” theory may not be the whole explanation, for Ms. Walsh one thing is for sure: “G.O.P. gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie’s decision to turn his back on his moderate Republican legacy and run as a race-baiting Trump Republican was a disaster.” Read more »

Jamelle Bouie in Slate: 
Mr. Bouie sees lessons in Tuesday’s election for all sides. He advises Democratic candidates to ride on the anti-Trump energy that propelled so many into office this election cycle. Moreover, the lesson for Republicans is to learn just how ineffective “Trumpism without Trump” can be. The strategy, which he defines as “just a euphemism for the politics of white identity,” is a key to understanding why Mr. Gillespie lost the governorship. Finally, he reminds his readers that “the rules of politics still apply.” Adding that “unpopular presidents make for unpopular parties.” Read more »

Benjamin Wallace-Wells in The New Yorker:
It is clear to Mr. Wallace-Wells that “Trumpism without Trump” isn’t a winning strategy for Republican candidates. It may even become toxic to the president himself, who is struggling without a significant legislative accomplishment. “Part of the difference may simply be that a Trump presidency is no longer an abstraction,” Mr. Wallace-Wells writes, and that the rhetoric of racial grievance plays better on the campaign trail than in office.

Nate Silver in Five Thirty Eight:
Mr. Silver argues that no one should be surprised that a Democratic wave of victories occurred for an opposition party during a midterm election, particularly with a president with approval ratings as low as those of Mr. Trump. Looking to the 2018 midterms, Mr. Silver is cautiously optimistic about the fate of Democrats looking to continue their victories. He explains why pundits misinterpret polling and election results, writing that there is “tendency to fight the last war.” He concludes, however, that “while Tuesday’s results may not change the reality of the 2018 outlook all that much, it could change perceptions about it, and that could have some knock-on effects.” Read more »

Dana Milbank in Washington Post:
Even though the president was thousands of miles away during the election, Mr. Milbank writes, he was very much on the ballot in Virginia. Mr. Gillespie’s loss is Mr. Trump’s loss, he argues, though the Democrats’ win is accompanied by a “depressing asterisk.” Mr. Gillespie’s campaign is a sad reminder that “racial animus and cultural grievances are a greater factor than conventional issues such as economic well-being.” Read more »
