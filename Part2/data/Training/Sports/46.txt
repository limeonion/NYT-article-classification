Knicks Fall to Raptors and DeMar DeRozan, the N.B.A.’s Leading Scorer - The New York Times
TORONTO — DeMar DeRozan scored 33 points, Norman Powell added 19, and the Raptors defeated the Knicks, 118-107, on Saturday night, Toronto’s fourth straight victory in meetings between the teams.
DeRozan, the N.B.A.’s leading scorer, had his eighth game of 30 points or more in nine starts this season, putting him in an exclusive club. In the last 50 years, only Michael Jordan, World B. Free and Tiny Archibald have started a season by registering 30 or more points in eight of the first nine games.
Carmelo Anthony had 31 points for the Knicks, while Kristaps Porzingis and Derrick Rose had 21 each. Kyle Lowry finished with 16 points for the Raptors.
Led by their superstars, the Raptors and the Knicks went back and forth over the opening 12 minutes, with DeRozan scoring 9 points and Anthony scoring 10.
The teams traded the lead 12 times, and the Knicks ended the first quarter on top, 28-24.
Kyle Lowry, who finished with 16 points, put the Raptors up by 4 with 1 minute 41 seconds to play on a driving layup. Lucas Nogueira’s two consecutive blocks, on Anthony and then Rose, put Toronto in control.
On the next play, DeRozan was fouled on a driving layup and was serenaded with chants of “M.V.P.! M.V.P.!” as he shot the subsequent free throw.
The Knicks are 4-9 against the Raptors in their last 13 meetings.
