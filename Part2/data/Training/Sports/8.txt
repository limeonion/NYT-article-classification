Godley (7-7) allowed three hits, walked six and struck out seven over six innings to help Arizona sweep a three-game series from the Rockies. The Diamondbacks increased their lead over Colorado for the top National League wild-card spot to six and a half games. The slumping Rockies’ lead over Milwaukee for the second wild card was trimmed to just a half-game.
